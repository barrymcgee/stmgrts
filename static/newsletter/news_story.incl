<p>There was a time when young people in Richmond and Twickenham dressed to impress. They wore hipster trousers and button-down Ben Sherman shirts, Biba dresses and Mary Quant skirts. Hairstyles were by Vidal Sassoon and John Anthony, the hairdresser in Heath Road. Shoes came from Ravel and suits from Italy via the East End of London. The <em>'faces'</em>rode motor scooters and went to clubs like the Pontiac, Klooks Kleek, the Carousel in Farnborough and the Ricky Tick in Windsor.</p>

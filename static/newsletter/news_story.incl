<p>Resting under an ancient yew tree in the graveyard of All Saints Church in Old Isleworth is a pit containing the bodies of 149 souls who died from the Bubonic Plague of 1665 -1666. In 18 months this epidemic killed an estimated 100,000 people â€“ almost a quarter of London's population. Unlike the current COVID-19 pandemic which is caused by a virus the Bubonic plague was down to the Yersinia Pestis bacterium, transmitted through the bite of infected rat fleas. Every year thousands of cases of the plague are still reported to the World Health Organization, although with proper antibiotic treatment, the prognosis for victims is now much better.</p>

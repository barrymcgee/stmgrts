    <p>What is that eerie screech you can hear echoing across the deserted garden? A two-ton bronze door perhaps swinging open on a Victorian mausoleum or the rasp of fingernails scratching across a wooden coffin lid? Who are those lost souls sighing in the night, so many years apart, now finally reunited? Could it be Black Jack Kilmorey, dead now for 140 years, reaching through eternity for his one true love the beautiful Priscilla Hoste dead since 1854 but not forgotten?</p>

    <p>The Ultra Low Emission Zone expansion is due to come into effect on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October with the western boundary of the zone following the A205 south circular into the borough of Richmond Upon Thames, placing Townmead Road Re-use and Recycling Centre and Mortlake Crematorium inside the zone. Some residents with older cars will be forced to pay Â£12.50 to access these two important community services. Richmond council have contacted Transport for London and requested these key amenities be removed from the zone but have not, as yet, been successful.</p>

    <p>Following the fatal stabbing in Craneford Way playing fields on the afternoon of Tuesday 12 October, I would firstly like to extend my deepest condolences to all the family and friends of the victim. My thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic and shocking incident, in particular the staff, students and their parents at Richmond upon Thames College, where the victim was a student.</p>

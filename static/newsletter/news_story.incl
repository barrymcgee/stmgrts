<p>In 1965, long before Spotify, Pandora and Shazam John Lennon bought himself a juke box to take on tour. It wasn't one of those 'wailing wardrobe' Rock Ola plastic cathedrals of flashing lights and coloured neon tubes that you might have bopped to at your local coffee bar. John's jukebox was a portable device about the size of a medium suitcase and made in the UK by KB Discomatic.</p>

<p>At our Twickenham Studios campus in St Margarets we have been delivering world class Films and TV for over 100 years. In that time, we have achieved some extraordinary success from our cutting-edge facilities, including Oscar-winning sound work on Bohemian Rhapsody just last year amongst many others. We now want to build on that success while reimagining ourselves as more a part of the local community here in St Margarets.</p>

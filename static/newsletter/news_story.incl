<p>One of the giants of British popular music died on Tuesday 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2021 aged 90.  Without his influence and encouragement, Britain would not have found its enthusiasm for skiffle, jazz and the blues. Without him, pivotal artists like Big Bill Broonzy, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee and Muddy Waters would not be recognised today.</p>

<p>Although we have only met once Mr B and I have had a long business relationship, every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, going back decades.  Our only meeting was about 15 years ago, early one summer morning. I was coming home after a night out and he was delivering milk. I strolled over and introduced myself and he did the same and that was that.</p>

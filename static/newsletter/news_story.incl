<p>Two important events happened on the day that I was born, Thursday 28<sup>th</sup> December 1944. David Lloyd George announced his retirement from Parliament and my father, Fred, put my name down on the waiting list for the Cubs at the '111th North London' group in Tottenham.  Fred had been an enthusiastic Scout and he had met my mother at a Scout Dance and neither events had done him much harm so he thought he would do the same for me.</p>

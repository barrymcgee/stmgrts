<p>On Christmas Day 1944 my mother Peggy was in the Maternity Ward at the Royal Northern Hospital in Holloway, North London waiting for me to arrive. I was already two weeks overdue and the story goes that the midwives were gathering round the bed and pointing at my mum's impressive bump saying "We know you're in there. If you don't come out immediately, we're going to come in and get you!"</p>

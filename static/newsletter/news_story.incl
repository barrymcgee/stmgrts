<p>Munira Wilson, MP for Twickenham, has today voted against Boris Johnson's trade deal with the European Union, stating it was "bad for jobs, bad for businesses and bad for our environment". It is the only trade deal in history that puts up barriers to trade rather than takes them away. Crucially, it contains very little for our service sector which constitutes 80% of the UK economy. It leaves this key industry in limbo and subject to future negotiations.</p>

LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



GASS DAY - SATURDAY, 31 AUGUST 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In other places it might be called "A Yard Sale" or "A Garage Sale"
    or even "A Car Boot Sale" but not in North St Margarets. There is a
    'Sale' coming all right but you won't find a Car or a Boot, or a
    Garage or a Yard for that matter. In North St Margarets their
    street sale is called "G.A.S.S Day" which fans of acronyms might
    recognise as "Grand Annual Street Sale". Acronym fans will also
    recognise that it is run by NSMRA - the North St Margarets
    Residents Association - and like all good street sales it takes
    place in the street.

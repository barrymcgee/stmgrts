:: ST MARGARETS COMMUNITY WEBSITE NEWSLETTER :: 

3 May 2006

Welcome to the St Margarets Community Website Newsletter. 
Each Thursday we will send you the latest news and events from the website (https://stmargarets.london).

LATEST NEWS
===========================================================




GO VOTE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tommorow between 7am and 10pm you can vote.

It is perhaps the most imporant thing you can do in a democracy and judging from the comments on this site and on "www.twickenham-online.co.uk":http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archives/20100114165808/http://oncomarchive.com/newsdev/news/archive.php?sheet_name=Twickenham there is a lot to think about.

Vote and make a difference.


LOCAL POLITICS FOR LOCAL PEOPLE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The local elections take place on Thursday the 4th of May. You can
    vote at your designated polling station between 7am and 10pm, but 
    how will you vote? Each ward has three seats on the council. 
    St Margarets and North Twickenham have ten candidates standing.
    
    In order to help you decide we have asked all the candidates a
    series of questions on your behalf. You can read each candidate's
    profile in full here. We have tried to ask questions that will
    give us a better idea of the candidates as people but we can now
    open the questions up to you the people who actually count. You
    can ask all or any of the candidates whatever questions you like.
    The questions will be posted on the website and it is up to each
    of the candidates to check the website and to respond to your 
    questions. You the voters can then see whether your questions 
    have been answered and whether or not you like the answer.
    
    The rules are simple you must be polite and well mannered, 
    remember everybody can read what is put up! We reserve the right
    not to post any comments, which we feel are offensive or 
    inappropriate in any way.
    
    This is democracy in action folks. The politicians complain that
    they can't speak directly to the voters and are managed by the 
    media. The voters complain that the politicians never answer the
    question asked. The power of the Internet allows us to bring 
    every candidate to every voter online. Every voters question 
    will remain up for all to see and requiring an answer. So no 
    room for wriggling, obfuscation, or dissembling. The challenge 
    has been set if you don't ask the questions how can they be
    held accountable?

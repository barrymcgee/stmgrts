LATEST NEWS
===========================================================



CHRIS BARBER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    One of the giants of British popular music died on Tuesday 2nd
    March 2021 aged 90. Without his influence and encouragement,
    Britain would not have found its enthusiasm for skiffle, jazz and
    the blues. Without him, pivotal artists like Big Bill Broonzy,
    Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee and Muddy
    Waters would not be recognised today.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Richmond upon Thames residents are being urged to make efforts

RICHMOND COUNCIL SUPPORTS OVER 6,000 RESIDENTS WITH 100% COUNCIL TAX RELIEF
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Richmond upon Thames has been able to provide 100% Council Tax
    reductions for 6,309 residents, providing a financial lifeline
    for many during the COVID-19 pandemic, Richmond's Full Council
    heard at the annual Budget Meeting on Tuesday night. This
    discretionary support is over and above statutory relief,
    for example to student households.

THE HOUNSLOW GRAIL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I know that this area is not exactly Dingley Dell when it comes
    to fairies, archaeological mysteries and things that go bump in the
    night, although it is worth noting that some folk think that
    Brentford sits across a portal to Hades, that the ghost of
    Elizabeth 1st haunts Richmond Palace and Twickenham is part of the
    mystical Kingston Zodiac... but then suddenly the Holy Grail crops
    up - in Hounslow!

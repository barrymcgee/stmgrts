<p><img src="https://stmargarets.london/assets/images/2007/party_with_plg-thumb.jpg" width="150" height="112" alt="Police Parting" align="right" style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" /></p>

<p>On Friday, 19 January, the St Margarets and North Twickenham Police Liason Group are holding a <a href="https://stmargarets.london/event/Party/200701070628">Community Party</a> in Winchester Hall at the Turks Head Pub.  They have booked a DJ who will be playing loads of fun music from the 70&#8217;s, 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s a there will be a cash bar all night.</p>

<p>Everyone is invited, you just have to get a ticket by contacting the Safer Neighbourhood Team at 020 8721 2912 or 07879 432330 or emailing  <a href="mailto:stmargarets.northtwickenham.snt@met.police.uk">stmargarets.northtwickenham.snt@met.police.uk</a>.   You must be over 18.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2007/01/double_yellow_l.html">Double Yellow Lines for St Stephen&#39;s School</a></h3>

<p>Sometime in the next month, double yellow lines will be added to the junctions of Winchester Road near St Stephen&#8217;s CE Junior School.  Hopefully this will remove many of the dangerously parked cars which make it difficult for children to safely cross the street.</p>

<p>There will also be a consultation about pedestrianizing Winchester Road from the Turks Head to the end of Winchester, near the A316.</p>

<p>Additionaly, the school is appealing to parents to stop parking on the yellow zig-zag lines outside the school, these are in place to enhance children&#8217;s safty, not for parents to pick up and drop off..  This is illegal and the school as arranged for the police and traffic wardens to help fine cars who do stop.</p>

<h3><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2006/12/online_communit.html">Online Communities Network Closing Down</a></h3>

<p>The Online Communities (OnComm), the group behind many Richmond Borough sites (e.g. <a href="http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archives/20100114165808/http://oncomarchive.com/newsdev/news/archive.php?sheet_name=Twickenham">twickenham-online.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archives/20100114165812/http://oncomarchive.com/newsdev/news/archive.php?sheet_name=Richmond">richmond-online.co.uk</a>,  <a href="http://www.mogden.org.uk/">Mogden Sewage Treatment Community Site</a>, etc&#8230;) has <a href="http://www.say-it-all.com/newsdev/admin/story.php?intro_id=2034">announced</a> that it is closing down after Christmas.</p>

<p>Oncom has been been supporting grassroots e-democracy for ten years, but has never been able to secure government funding.  They have built up a huge readership and given a voice to the people on many divisive issues.  The VoxPop forums have been a particularly powerful tool to talk directly with Councillors.</p>

<p>With all the talk about e-democracy, it is a shame that Oncom could not find the funding they require to keep going.  The Oncom sites played an important part of our community and the platform they provided will be sadly missed.</p>

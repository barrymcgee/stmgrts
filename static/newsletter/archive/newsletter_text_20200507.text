INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN STUDY ON DENSITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is hard to find land in London to build on. One suggestion is
    to increase density - to allow more to be built on a piece of land.

    residents think about this.

HELP WATER TREES OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Help is wanted to water many of the young trees planted across

    good start to the growing season.

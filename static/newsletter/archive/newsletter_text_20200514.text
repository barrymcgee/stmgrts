MORE THAN JUST A BAD DAY?

PARKING ENFORCEMENT UPDATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Enforcement on all on-street parking will recommence on Monday 25th

    against dangerous parking and relaxed day-to-day parking
    enforcement. Free parking for NHS staff, carers and volunteers will
    still be in place.

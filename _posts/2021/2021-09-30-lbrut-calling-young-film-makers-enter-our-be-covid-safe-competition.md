Young filmmakers in the borough could be in with the chance of winning  great prizes, including a family paddling boarding session and tickets to  Kew Gardens at Christmas, by entering a local competition to promote  Covid-safety.

As we head into winter, it is so important that COVID-19 levels are kept as  low as possible in the borough. Therefore, Richmond Council is appealing to  young people in the borough to help by creating eye-catching films  outlining what people can do to keep themselves safe.

There are two categories in the competition, each with their own great  prizes:

### 12-15 year olds are invited to create short videos discussing:

The top two winners in this category will take home a family ticket (2  adults and 2 children) to Christmas at Kew Gardens OR a pair of tickets for  singalong The Greatest Showman at Richmond Theatre.

### 16-17 year olds year are invited to create short videos discussing:

The top two winners in this category will take home a voucher for paddle  boarding (2 adults and 2 young people) for a two- hour paddle boarding  class with Active 360 Richmond OR a &pound;40 voucher for a local cinema.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "We know that COVID-19 has not gone away. The changes to COVID-19  restrictions earlier this year saw us all breathe a sigh of relief that  things would return to normal.

> "However, whilst these changes gave us more freedom, we are not out of the  woods yet and it would be foolish of us all to think that COVID-19 has gone  away.

> "We still need to take steps to protect ourselves, our families and those  around us. If we don't get the virus under control by winter, there will be  consequences.

> "So, we need to enlist the help of our younger, creative residents in the  borough. It is so easy these days to create short videos, either on our  phones or on a camera. We would like young people to come forward with  their videos on why it is important to stay safe.

> "We have some great prizes, and I would encourage as many young people as  possible to enter. We all need to work together to combat this virus."

Nine local community projects have been awarded £304,000 in the fourth round of Richmond Council's Community Fund.

The Community Fund comes from the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL), a tax collected by the Council and paid by developers (15% or 25% in neighbourhood plan areas). A portion of the total tax collected will fund local priority projects which address the impact development has on an area.

This money might be used for a variety of projects, including; green space improvements, resources and equipment for community use or community centre renovations.

In the Autumn of 2020, the Council invited local residents, businesses and community groups, living or operating within the borough, to bring forward proposals.

Following a review of the applications, the Finance, Policy and Resources Committee (18th February 2021) agreed, with cross-party support, funding for the following projects:

- Improving community facilities for inclusive access, to include lighting and tactile rails/flooring at East Twickenham Neighbourhood Association Community Centre.
- Cycle Rack Provision at Hampton Pools, Hampton
- Conversion of church hall at St Mark's Church in Hampton Wick into a workshop for community repair projects - a social interaction / loneliness and isolation project called Sheddington.
- Accessible toilets and refreshment kiosk at Marble Hill Playcentres
- Extension and refurbishment of Kneller Gardens Pavilion, Twickenham - through Friends of Kneller Gardens
- Refurbishment of skate park in Heatham House Youth Centre, Twickenham
- Refurbishment of Multi Use Games Area in Heathfield Recreation Ground, Heathfield - through Friends of Heathfield Recreation Ground and Environs
- Sports hall and audio equipment for Mortlake Power Station Youth Club
- 10 'Green Hubs' - thriving biodiversity hot spots in currently underutilised spaces, - through Habitats and Heritage

This means that now over &pound;1.5m has now been awarded as part of the fund since it was launched.

Councillor Michael Wilson, Deputy Chair of the Finance, Policy and Resources Committee said:

> "The COVID-19 pandemic has really demonstrated the importance of our communities and many more people have been accessing the facilities and provisions on their doorstep. The pandemic will forever change the way we live, so it is critical to ensure we have strong local infrastructure to support growing and changing communities.

> "We know that residents have a strong vision for the future of their community. The Community Fund helps make some of the community ideas and initiatives a reality.

> "It's great that we have been able to support such a diverse number of projects put forward by the community that will help improve the local environment or facilities available in their local areas. I look forward to seeing how these projects progress."

The Richmond and Kingston Youth Council's Richmond Climate Change Youth Fund is available to those aged 11-19 who want to develop new and exciting project ideas to help tackle climate change!

Projects should aim to improve young people's awareness and knowledge on climate change. They should focus on one or more of the below areas:

- Energy efficiency and water saving
- Air quality (travel)
- Waste and recycling
- Re-using / repurposing / fast fashion

Applicants can be awarded up to &pound;1,500 and can apply between 1 April and 31 May 2021. Applicants must live or go to school in Richmond upon Thames and have an adult sponsor who will be supporting the climate change project - for example a teacher, parent or youth worker.

The Fund is managed by the Kingston and Richmond Youth Council and supported by Richmond Council and Achieving for Children.

Lydia Roebuck, Chair of the Kingston and Richmond Youth Council, said:

> "Young people are passionate about climate change and we at the Kingston and Richmond Youth Council want to empower them to develop their ideas to tackle this important issue.

> "Thanks to Richmond Council, our Climate Change Commissioning fund is about enabling young people in Richmond to develop their own projects to generate more awareness of climate change and really make a difference."

Colin Cooper, CEO of Habitats & Heritage, a local charity that is dedicated to looking after the natural and historic environment in the borough, said:

> "It's great to see the Youth Council encouraging young people to come up with innovative projects to tackle climate change. As we have seen with the impact Greta Thunberg has achieved, young people can have real influence.

> "One of Habitats & Heritage's key aims is to get young people learning about the issues confronting our planet and to become proactive problem solvers for the natural environment on their doorsteps. I wish all applicants the best of luck!"

The Leader of Richmond Council has welcomed productive discussions with the  organisers of Parkrun, in anticipation of three local events returning to  Richmond upon Thames if England moves to Step 4 of the Government's roadmap  on 19 July.

Step 4 of the roadmap is expected to mean there will be no limit on  numbers, no requirement for social distancing and no legal requirement for  face coverings to be worn at public sporting events. A move to Step 4 on 19  July is subject to the Government's announcement on 12 July.

Councillor Gareth Roberts said:

> "I am pleased we are now looking forward to welcoming the Parkrun events  back to this borough. There has never been any question of their return -  it has been a matter of timing and reaching an agreement on additional  safety measures to keep both runners and members of the public safe.

> "We had hoped to be able to have Parkrun return to the borough before now,  but we were clear that there needed to be a coordinated approach across  London that other measures, such requesting participants wear face  coverings while congregating, were put in place. I am disappointed that  organisers were not willing to engage with the Council on these matters and  that local residents have had to wait for the final lifting of Government  restrictions for these events to return.

> "Any decisions we take around events in the borough, always have the health  of all residents and visitors being placed front and centre. I am pleased  Parkrun have now committed to working with us to address concerns and risks  specific to our parks and open spaces, so we can now look forward to the  safe return of these popular events."

The St Margarets Fair is on Saturday, 11 September 2021 from noon to 5pm in Moormead Park. For over 40 years the fair has been a fantastic day out.

This year the fair will be a little bit different with shorter hours and fewer live activities.  But there will still be great food, drinks, stalls, activities and a wonderful programme of music.

All the money raised by the fair in the Bar, BBQ, Pimm's and prosecco stall, tea and cake tent, swing boats and silent auction goes straight into the our local five schools and several local charities.

There will not be a Dog show this year.

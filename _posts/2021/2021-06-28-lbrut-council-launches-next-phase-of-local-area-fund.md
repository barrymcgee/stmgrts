Richmond Council is welcoming applications for its Local Area Fund, which  provides funding for local ward areas to support community driven projects  to improve the quality of life and wellbeing of local communities.  Individuals, local groups and organisations can all apply for the fund.

The Local Area Fund was introduced in 2020 to provide funding to support  local initiatives, help launch new ideas and developing projects to make a  positive difference to the borough. Each ward in the borough has been  allocated a budget of &pound;10,000 for local projects.

Through this fund Richmond Council is keen to work with local people and  organisations to improve their local community. The Council is asking  residents, local groups and organisations to come forward with innovative  ideas that reflect local priorities and improve the overall quality of life  in Richmond upon Thames.

The Council's Community Engagement Team are looking to work with residents  to help develop projects in each local area. The Council is also  encouraging residents to get in touch with their local Ward Councillors to  discuss their project ideas and the difference their project could make to  the ward. Find your [local Ward Councillor](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/council/councillors).

If a Ward Councillor is supportive of a local project, they can provide an  endorsement as part of the application process. Individuals and groups who  are not looking to apply for funding can still share their ideas of ways  to improve their local areas with the Council who can then help  to support these ideas.

Previous examples of some of the projects awarded funding during the last  round of applications include the building of a wooded play area and nature  trail structure for children under 12 in East Sheen, intergenerational  music therapy sessions for children and older people in Kew, the creation  of a new gaming lounge for young people at Ham Youth Centre and the  creation of a sensory garden for local community use in Twickenham  Riverside.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Spokesperson for Communities, Equalities  & the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "During the pandemic, many of us have been able to spend a lot more time getting to know our local areas and communities and am sure we all have ideas for small improvements that could be made! The Local Area Fund provides residents with a unique opportunity to improve their local areas by helping to turn your bright ideas into a reality by providing funding directly to local groups and organisations. The Local Area Fund has already helped to improve many areas across the borough and we want this to continue.

> "I would strongly encourage anyone with an idea, no matter what that idea is, to approach their local representative and discuss their ideas with us. All ideas will be considered. Let us know your big ideas to improve your local area."

Last week, during the school half-term holidays, Richmond Council's Environment and Community Services Directorate welcomed 16 students for a week-long virtual work experience programme.

Across the week, students from Richmond upon Thames worked across areas such as planning applications, parking policy, engineering, transport strategy, a local plan consultation, speed networking as well as working on professional skills such as CV writing.

The week of work experience included a varied programme of activities for students to contribute to, with opportunities for them to develop key skills which Council officers require in their day-to-day work.

Abdulrahman, a student at St Richard Reynolds Catholic College said:

> "I learnt a tremendous amount from the engineering and planning elements of the transport system - It's really interesting to see how much effort goes into achieving sustainability which promotes a green future! I'd recommend you join if you're interested in gaining insight into a green future, sustainability and how planning & engineering works"

Joanna Chambers, Senior Planner for Richmond Council said:

> "The students in my group really enjoyed the week and so did I. It was really refreshing to spend time with them...it reminds us of the need to be inclusive and to remember whose future we are planning for."

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee said:

> "Work experience with the Council is an invaluable opportunity for students to get an insight into how the Council works. I am delighted that the Council's Environment and Community Services Directorate were able to give our young residents exposure to the work of the Council and hopefully inspire them to consider a career in public service in the future."

The week-long placement concluded with students presenting to a panel of senior council officers and the President of the Royal Town Planning Institute.

The programme was designed as part of Richmond Council's Environment and Community Services ongoing efforts to make ensure its workforce is representative of the Borough.

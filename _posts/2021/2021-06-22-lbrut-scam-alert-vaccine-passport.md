Scam emails are being circulated impersonating the NHS and pretending that  people can start applying for a 'Coronavirus Digital Passport'.

Clicking on the 'Get Digital Passport' link takes you to a convincing but  fake NHS website that asks for personal and payment details (for a 'process  fee').

This is a scam. Please help us to spread the word by sharing this message  with your friends and family.

Your vaccination status is obtained for free through the NHS app, NHS  website or by phoning the NHS on 119.

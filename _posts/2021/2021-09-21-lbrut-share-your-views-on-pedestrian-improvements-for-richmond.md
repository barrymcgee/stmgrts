Have your say on suggested improvements in Richmond Town Centre including  two new crossings and an upgrade to footways and greenery along Hill Rise.

As part of its effort to assist local businesses and residents returning to  using town centres after the COVID-19 pandemic's lockdowns, Richmond  Council formed a working group comprised of local stakeholders, ward  members, Council officers and consultants to decide on how to improve  Richmond Town Centre.

These improvements are centred around making Richmond Town Centre safer,  easier and more enjoyable for residents, visitors and businesses.

Three of these proposed improvements are:

1. The installation of a zebra crossing near Richmond Bridge between the Pitcher and Piano pub and Bills Restaurant.
2. The installation of a raised crossing point on Parkshot Road outside Merevale House to assist students and pedestrians.
3. Upgrading the footways and parking bays, as well as installing planters, between the junction of Hill Rise and Petersham Road up to the Vineyard Road.

Richmond Council is inviting residents to share their feedback on the  proposed measures by visiting the [consultation page](https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/richmondecs/rtc-21/) where you can have your say and view the full details and drawings.

The consultation closes on 10 October 2021. If you require the consultation  on paper, please contact 020 8891 1411.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee for  Richmond Council, said:

> "We want people to feel safe when walking around Richmond Town Centre and  to enjoy spending time there.

> "We hope that residents, visitors and businesses benefit from safer  crossing points and the upgraded stretch of footways and parking bays, as  well as the new parklet. Please share your feedback."

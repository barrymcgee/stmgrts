The Governing Board of Orleans Primary School is seeking to appoint a highly organised and self-motivated clerk to join our outstanding school. The Clerk is accountable to the governing board, working effectively with the Chair of Governors, the Headteacher and other governors to ensure the efficient functioning of the board.

The Clerk to the Governors provides:

- administrative and organisational support, including but not limited to preparing agendas and meeting papers, attending committee and full board meetings, taking and distributing minutes, monitoring communications to the Governing Body, and keeping records and up-to-date information on policies
- guidance to ensure that the board works in compliance with the appropriate legal and regulatory framework, providing procedural and legislative advice to the governing board
- advice on procedural matters relating to board operation including sharing expertise on membership and terms of office, committee structure, self-evaluation best practice and more

The ideal candidate has excellent organisational, time-management, communication and ICT skills.

This is a part-time role, of approximately 15-20 hours per month. The Clerk will cover 6 full board and around 18 committee meetings per school year. Meetings are held in term time with full board meetings held in the evening at approximately 6:30pm and committee meetings held during the school day. The Clerk is also expected to attend all relevant training events and briefings. This role would suit both professional Clerks or someone who would like to qualify as a professional Clerk. Training is available for the right candidate.

The Clerk is paid through payroll and hours payable include the whole meeting process (emails, calls and agenda preparation; writing up and distributing minutes) and training events.

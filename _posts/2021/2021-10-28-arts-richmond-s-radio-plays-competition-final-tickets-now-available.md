Join Arts Richmond from 3 to 5pm on Sunday 7 November for the final of their Radio Plays Competition in memory of Twickenham actor, Colin Skipp (Tony Archer).

The afternoon will be hosted by Nancy Baldwin and LBRUT Mayor, Cllr Geoff Acton in the Mayor's Parlour. Joining the finalists will be special guests who include the Skipp family and Buffy Davis who plays Jolene Archer in the UK's longest running radio drama.

The four finalists, Anna Burns, Patricia Cammish, Annie Morris and Carolyn Pertwee will present their pre-recorded plays and the winner will be presented with a cup and &pound;100 prize by the Skipp family.

This will be a free live stream event; however, donations will be welcome to support Arts Richmond and its local projects.

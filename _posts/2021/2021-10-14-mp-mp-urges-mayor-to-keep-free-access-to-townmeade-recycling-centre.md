    The Ultra Low Emission Zone expansion is due to come into effect on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October with the western boundary of the zone following the A205 south circular into the borough of Richmond Upon Thames, placing Townmead Road Re-use and Recycling Centre and Mortlake Crematorium inside the zone. Some residents with older cars will be forced to pay &pound;12.50 to access these two important community services. Richmond council have contacted Transport for London and requested these key amenities be removed from the zone but have not, as yet, been successful.

The Ultra Low Emission Zone expansion is due to come into effect on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October with the western boundary of the zone following the A205 south circular into the borough of Richmond Upon Thames, placing Townmead Road Re-use and Recycling Centre and Mortlake Crematorium inside the zone. Some residents with older cars will be forced to pay &pound;12.50 to access these two important community services. Richmond council have contacted Transport for London and requested these key amenities be removed from the zone but have not, as yet, been successful.

After receiving emails from concerned residents, Munira Wilson, MP for Twickenham, wrote to Sadiq Khan, the Moyor of London asking for him to intervene. In the letter Munira said:

> "I am concerned that introducing this charge to access the Recycling Centre could lead to a rise in fly tipping with all of the associated environmental, safety and cost implications. Charging people to drive to a crematorium and graveyard also seems morally wrong."

Munira pointed out that both the Townmead Road Recycling Centre and Mortlake Cemetery and Crematorium could easily be removed from the charging zone without any wider impact to the integrity of the scheme.

> "Townmead road is only used to access these amenities, some sporting facilities and a few residential roads. As Townmead road is a dead end, it could easily be removed from the ULEZ zone"

She closed the letter buy urging the Mayor to intervene with TfL.

> "I urge you to review this aspect of the ULEZ zone with the TfL team responsible and find a way to retain free access to key facilities for my constituents."

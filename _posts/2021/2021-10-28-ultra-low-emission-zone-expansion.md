Since Monday, 25 October 2021, the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) has been expanded to cover all roads within the North and South Circular roads - operating 24 hours, seven days a week (except Christmas Day.)

A comprehensive body of evidence highlights that air pollution causes thousands of premature deaths in the capital each year and is linked to lifelong conditions including underdeveloped lungs and asthma. The ULEZ scheme in central London successfully reduced nitrogen dioxide emissions by 44% and the expectation is that the expanded zone will lead to a 30% reduction in nitrogen oxides.

The scheme has been developed over several years. When the Mayor announced his intention to expand the zone, in February 2017, only 39% of vehicles in inner London met the required cleaner vehicle standards. Today this has risen to 87%, highlighting the scheme's effectiveness already in accelerating the switch to cleaner vehicles and cleaning up London's air.

TfL is urging drivers to use its [online vehicle checker](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/check-your-vehicle/) to make sure they don't get caught out.

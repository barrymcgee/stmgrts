Cllr John Coombs, Spokesperson for Arts, said:

> "I am absolutely delighted that the RichmondLive festival will be taking place in the borough this August and September with so many amazing free events for residents to enjoy. This year's festival promises to be extra special following the lack of live performances over the past seventeen months due to the pandemic.

> "I would encourage all residents to get out to see as much of the wonderful performance on offer for this year's RichmondLive festival and support our local arts who have suffered greatly during the pandemic. The festival will provide the perfect opportunity for residents to get back out and explore the borough. I look forward to seeing you there."

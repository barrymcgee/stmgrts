With schools closing and children having to be educated at home during the latest lockdown, we have made the decision to once again offer a second-hand tech drop-off point at the club every Saturday.

We will have a drive-through drop-off point at the entrance of the Richmond Athletic Ground every Saturday from 11 am to 1 pm for anyone who wishes to donate laptops or tablets to support families and their children who do not have the necessary technology at home to continue their schooling.

The laptops/tablets will then be professionally wiped clean and reloaded with updated software thanks to Veritas Digital Services, before being donated to local schools for distribution to children throughout our community.

#### WHEN?

Every Saturday from 11am to 1pm.

#### WHERE?

The main entrance to the Richmond Athletic Ground, Twickenham Road, TW9 2SF.

We will be operating a drive-through service only so please remain in your car when dropping-off tech.

#### WHAT?

We require working laptops or tablets, with the relevant power cables. As mentioned these will be professionally wiped clean and updated with new software before being donated. We do not require old mobile phones, kindles, desktop PCs etc.

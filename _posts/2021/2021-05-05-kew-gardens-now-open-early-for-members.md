Members of Kew Gardens can enjoy exclusive early  access to the gardens from 8am.

Members of Kew Gardens can now enjoy the early-morning fresh air without the crowds. The Victoria Plaza caf&#233; on the grounds will also be open early.  On Saturdays and Sundays, the Children's Garden will be available.

Members can enjoy these exclusive benefits until 30 September, however,  pre-booking before you arrive remains essential.

On 1 May Kew Gardens opened their brand new "Secret World of Plants":https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on/secret-world-of-plants which gives visitors a way to rediscover the natural world and delight in  its secret details with a summer series of immersive experiences.

For many people Christmas means homes are stocked with the latest must-have gifts, and unfortunately thieves see this as an opportunity to commit burglaries.

It's important to #OutsmartBurglars and get into a routine whenever you leave your home by doing the following:

- Close and lock all your doors and windows - a common mistake of many festive decorators is to feed extension cables through partially open windows, criminals know to look for this vulnerability
- Double-lock doors
- Put valuables and gifts out of sight
- Keep handbags away from the letterbox or cat flap and hide all keys including car keys, as a thief could hook keys or valuables through even a small opening
- Never leave car documents or ID in obvious places such as kitchens or hallways
- In the evening, shut the curtains and leave a light on
- If you are out for a long time, use a timer device to automatically turn lights and a radio on at night
- Set your burglar alarm
- Make sure the side gate is locked
- Lock your shed or garage
- Lock your bike inside a secure shed or garage

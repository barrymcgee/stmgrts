Residents in Richmond are invited to get their COVID-19 vaccine this  Saturday, at a walk-in clinic in the Town Centre, with no appointments or  NHS numbers required.

As the nation gears up for the removal of Covid restrictions later this  month, it is more important than ever that people get both doses of their  vaccine, to protect themselves and those around them.

The clinic will be at [Richmond Adult Community College](https://www.rhacc.ac.uk/how-find-us), from 10am to 6pm on Saturday 10 July.

No appointments will be needed and both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines  will be available. The walk-in clinic will allow people to attend at a time  that is convenient for them and means groups of friends can attend together  to have their first doses.

It is also an opportunity for people who missed their second dose of the  vaccine or haven't got round to booking it, to ensure they are fully  vaccinated. However, please remember that second doses are ONLY given to  those who received their first 8 weeks ago or more.

This is the latest walk-in clinic available in Richmond upon Thames - with  others planned in the weeks ahead around the borough.

Richmond GP, Dr Patrick Gibson said:

> "The NHS and Richmond Council have worked together closely to organise this  local walk-in clinic for Richmond residents to make getting the vaccination  as convenient and easy as possible.

> "If you're planning to be in Richmond in Saturday, or live near-by, and  haven't yet had your vaccine, please come along and see us.

> "If you missed your second dose of the vaccine or didn't get round to  booking it, you are also welcome to attend - but please make sure you had  your first jab eight weeks ago or more. Otherwise you will be turned away  and asked to return to a future clinic."

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing  Services Committee and Chair of the Health and Wellbeing Board at Richmond  Council, said:

> "Whilst many local people have had their vaccine, we know that there are  pockets of people who are still yet to have their jab. This includes people  who live in South Richmond.

> "With the restrictions about to be lifted, it is more important now than  ever to make sure that you are vaccinated. We can all see our case numbers  are rocketing. And whilst the vaccine can't totally prevent you from  getting the virus, it will reduce the likelihood of you needing to go to  hospital.

> "This walk-in is a perfect opportunity for people who are nervous and need  the moral support of friends to have the vaccine together, although please  be assured that NHS staff will always on hand to help anyone who is feeling  anxious.

> "When you attend your appointment please be prepared to queue and check  social media beforehand; in case the walk-in clinics are full. We recommend  you ensure you have eaten beforehand, bring a drink and dress appropriately  for the weather."

A recent study by Public Health England found that having both doses of the  vaccine significantly increased protection against the more transmissible  Delta and Beta variants.

People who have had both vaccinations can demonstrate their vaccination  status two weeks after their second dose through the NHS COVID Pass. This  can be used for travelling abroad to some countries and at a series of  event trials in England.

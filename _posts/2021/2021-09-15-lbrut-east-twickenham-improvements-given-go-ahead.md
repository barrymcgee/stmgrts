Richmond Council will begin design work for a package of public realm works  in East Twickenham, after a public consultation found that 68 per cent of  respondents want to see improvements for pedestrians in the area.

East Twickenham, which stretches from Richmond Bridge to St Margarets, is  a unique area with shops, restaurants and other services. The Council has  been in discussion with local residents groups for a number of years about  improvements that could make the area better for residents and visitors,  and to give it a clearer visual identity.

With the opening of Deer Park School and the Lidl supermarket, the case for  such improvements is even greater.

Following consultation with local residents on proposed works, the  Council's Transport and Air Quality Committee approved the move forward on  Monday 13 September 2021.

The works include:

- Full resurfacing of road and pavements
- The widening of pavements at key pinch points
- Improvements to the cycle link between the riverside towpath and Willoughby Road.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Council's Transport and Air Quality  Committee, said:

> "The Council is running a variety of work programmes focused on improving  local centres across the borough; giving them each their own distinct  character and creating an environment that locals and visitors want to come  to.

> "Many of the proposed works in East Twickenham are long overdue and we know  there is a great deal of enthusiasm for the investment from local residents  and traders for the future of this important high-street.

> "The consultation highlighted a number of resident priorities, including a  desire for air quality improvements.  With these works we can make East  Twickenham a more appealing shopping destination as well as lay the  ground-work for further interventions and investment in this important part  of the borough."

Richmond Council will be giving its garden waste collection customers five  free months of the service, as compensation for recent disruptions caused  by the crew shortages.

Throughout July and early August, there was a significant increase in the  number of people required to self-isolate after being contacted by the NHS  Test and Trace service. Combined with a national shortage in  collection vehicle drivers, there were not enough crew to continue  collections of all waste streams.

The Council made a logistical decision to prioritise household waste/food  collections followed by blue and black box recycling collections and  deploy all available staff to those collection rounds. This meant garden  waste collections had to be suspended.

As compensation for the suspended service, existing subscription holders  will be given free collections up to 31 March 2022. All subscribers have  been contacted directly with further details.

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture  and Sports Committee said:

> "The service is now back up and running. Since the government changed the  self-isolation rules for fully vaccinated people, we have seen a positive  impact on the availability of collection crew.

> "I am grateful for the patience and understanding shown by residents while  the service was suspended and I am pleased we have been able to come up  with this solution."

Following the Early May bank holiday on Monday 3 May, Richmond Council will  carry out general waste, food waste, garden waste and recycling collections  for domestic properties one day later than usual, for one week.

For example, Monday collections will take place on Tuesday, and Tuesday  collections on Wednesday.

Following the bank holiday:

- There will be no collections for bulky waste available on Monday 3 May
- There will be no change for those receiving commercial waste and recycling collection services

Normal domestic collection schedules for all waste and recycling services  will resume a week later on Monday 10 May 2021.

| Normal collection day | Revised collection day |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Monday 3 May          | Tuesday 4 May          |
| Tuesday 4 May         | Wednesday 5 May        |
| Wednesday 5 May       | Thursday 6 May         |
| Thursday 6 May        | Friday 7 May           |
| Friday 7 May          | Saturday 8 May         |

Residents are asked to ensure their recycling and refuse is available for  collection by 6am on collection day at the boundary of their property  beside the entrance, i.e. where their front garden or drive meets the  pavement.

To reduce issues with street litter and trip hazards, only households  without front gardens, drives or equivalent are permitted to present  recycling and refuse on the pavement and should only do this after 8pm on  the day before collection.

Residents are reminded that Townmead  Road Household Waste and Recycling  Centre will be open over the bank holiday, but pre-booking is essential.  Residents can  [book a slot](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/waste_and_recycling/recycling_and_refuse_sites/townmead_road/book_slot_townmead) to bring household waste to Townmead Road for free.

Classes to help students to revisit topics learnt in school and prepare them for their GCSE science exams.

Classes are open to all KS4 science students with a vision to advance knowledge and understanding of the key concepts in the GCSE science course. These classes will give students the opportunity to revisit topics they have learnt in school, allowing them to become more confident with the science curriculum. The classes will also prepare students for their GCSE exam by teaching them exam techniques as well as completing a variety of exam paper questions on each topic.

All lessons will be delivered by a fully qualified science teacher.

#### More information

- Classes will run on Saturday mornings in the [ETNA Community Centre](https://stmargarets.london/directory/other/201110040733) from 9-10am and 10-11am.

Twickenham Stadium will host the 2021 Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge  Cup finals with a limited number of fans permitted to attend both matches,  in line with the UK government's roadmap to recovery.

Up to 10,000 spectators will be able to buy tickets for each game with the  Challenge Cup decider scheduled for Friday 21 May at 20.00 and the Heineken  Champions Cup final going ahead on Saturday 22 May at 4.45pm. Both matches  are subject to licences being granted by Richmond Council.

The RFU is working closely with the Council, as well as with other key  stakeholders such as the Metropolitan police and South Western Railway, to  ensure the events are as safe as possible for spectators, staff and local  residents. Additional measures will be in place, including increased  cleaning, extra toilet provision, assigned gate entry and a revised  transport plan.

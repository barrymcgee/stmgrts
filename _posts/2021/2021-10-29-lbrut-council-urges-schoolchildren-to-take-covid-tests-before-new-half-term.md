Secondary school students are being urged to get tested for COVID-19 before they return to school after the October half term break.

Richmond Council is asking for all secondary school pupils to take a lateral flow test on Sunday night or Monday morning.

This message comes following a reported rise in cases, with a current case rate of 2,043 per 100,000 head of population in young people aged 11-16 years old.

Tests can be collected from some local pharmacies, and the below libraries:

- East Sheen Library, Sheen Lane, London, SW14 8LP
- Hampton Library, Rosehill, Hampton TW12 2AB
- Twickenham Library, Garfield Road, Twickenham TW1 3JT
- Whitton Library, 141 Nelson Road, Whitton TW2 7BB

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "It was brilliant to see children return to school in September with a much more rounded education.

> "Extra-curricular activities, school-trips and events were all able to take place, giving children the chance to catch-up on some of the more social activities that are so important to their learning and well-being.

> "We really want this to be able to continue through the second half of the autumn term, so we're asking parents and secondary school children to keep testing regularly, so that we can reduce the spread of the virus in schools and help keep children and school staff as safe as possible.

> "If every secondary school child takes a test before they return to school, then we will help to identify some of those who don't have symptoms and prevent them from taking the virus back into their classrooms."

Secondary school students can receive [symptom free test kits online](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/health_protection_information/coronavirus_information/book_lateral_flow_test), from some pharmacies and in local libraries.

In addition, parents of children aged 12-15 are reminded that if their child has yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19 they can [book an appointment](https://swlondonccg.nhs.uk/covid/where-can-you-get-vaccinated/vaccination-walk-in-clinics/) at the Stoop Rugby ground in Twickenham, the Stoop will be open every day next week (aside from Saturday).

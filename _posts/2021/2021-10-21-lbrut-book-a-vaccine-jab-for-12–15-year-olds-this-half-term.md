Children under 16 in England will be able to book a vaccination against COVID-19 over the half-term break, the NHS has announced.

Over the past few weeks, the NHS has been visiting schools across the borough vaccinating 12-15 year olds. However, to ensure that this age group can be vaccinated as soon as possible, from this weekend (23 October) appointments can also be booked, outside of school, on the NHS booking service - currently open only to those aged 16 and up. This will enable young people to get a jab at a nearby vaccination centre in the same way as adults can.

The move is designed to ensure that those who have not had the opportunity to be vaccinated at their school can still find a jab elsewhere rather than having to wait.

On Thursday 21 and Friday 22 October ONLY walk-in appointments are also available.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> 'As we have all seen from the rising case numbers in the borough, the biggest increase in Richmond is amongst young people, and many are not yet vaccinated.

> 'The guidance is clear. Having the vaccine is one way that we can all protect ourselves from the virus. There is also a wider picture to consider, that the vaccine has benefits beyond protecting the individual. It also helps minimise the risk of transmission to others.

> 'While we can't make parents' minds up for them, I can tell you what I have done. I have not hesitated. My two eligible daughters have both had the jab.

> 'I'd encourage parents to talk with their child about the decision and why the Chief Medical Officers are recommending that the vaccine is being offered to them. There are lots of resources that can help with this conversation.'

Richmond Community Choir is starting its new term Thursday, 9 September 2021 and rehearsing for the Christmas Season.

We are a welcoming choir, for all voices, and we do not ask for auditions - we only ask that you can hold a tune.   We've sung songs from 7 centuries and many lands.   We've performed in Spain, Germany and France, and most recently at Marble Hill, a little nearer!

Our rehearsals are at ETNA in Rosslyn Road at 6.45-8.15 on Thursdays.

We always offer new members a taster session.  Our termly fees are a very reasonable &pound;70. Why not try us out?  We have fun singing!

We'll have a stall at the St Margarets Fair so if you'd like to come and talk to us we will be there.

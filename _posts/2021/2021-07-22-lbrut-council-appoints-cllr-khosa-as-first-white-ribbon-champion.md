Richmond Council has appointed Councillor Ben Khosa as its first White  Ribbon Champion, with the role of driving forward the borough's work to  tackle violence against women and girls (VAWG).

The Council is aiming to lead the way in the borough of Richmond upon  Thames, working towards becoming a White Ribbon Accredited organisation and  is encouraging other organisations to do that same.

The accreditation means the Council meets the Public Sector Equality Duty  under the Equality Act 2010. Gaining the accreditation is a  challenging six stage process which can take several years to  achieve. It commits organisations to a strategic approach to ending male  violence against women by engaging with men and boys, changing cultures,  and raising awareness

Councillor Khosa is a ward councillor for St Margarets and North  Twickenham. He was Mayor of Richmond upon Thames from 2018-19 and while in  the role he fundraised to support domestic violence charity Refuge. In his  role as White Ribbon Champion, he will be involved in delivering the  Council's VAWG Strategy later this year. He will also work across the  borough to encourage other major organisations and businesses to become  White Ribbon Accredited and to put in place their own VAWG policies and  strategies.

Councillor Khosa said:

> "Tackling violence against women and girls has been a priority of this  Council since 2018, but the events of this year have made it clear that  globally we are not doing enough to end this widespread violation of human  rights.

> "We must do everything we can to keep women and girls safe in our public  spaces, online, as well as in their homes, workplaces and classrooms. But  we must also look at the long-term solution - addressing the attitudes and  behaviours that so frequently ends in male violence. This Council aspires  to bring about this culture change.

> "I have been personally involved in this work for a long time, so I am  pleased to now have the role of overseeing the Council's work and to  support officers as they finalise the Violence Against Women and Girls  Strategy this autumn, and work with communities across our borough to make  real, lasting change."

On Tuesday 21 September the German School London celebrated its 50<sup>th</sup>  Birthday, having first opened its doors on 21 September 1971.

50 years ago, on 20 September 1971, a VIP reception was held at Douglas  House in Petersham, South West London.

The party, which included the German Ambassador of the Federal Republic of  Germany, Karl-G&#252;nther von Hase and the British Secretary of State for  Education, Margaret Thatcher, was there to officially launch the first  German School in the UK. The next day, on the 21<sup>st</sup> of September, 84 pupils  walked through the doors of Douglas House to start their first day of  school.

50 years later and German School London has grown to over 800 pupils, from  ages 3 to 18 years and from over 30 different nations.

On Tuesday 21 September 2021, the whole community gathered to celebrate  their 50<sup>th</sup> birthday. Also in attendance was the school's original secretary  in 1971, Roswitha Guest, and a delegation from the German Embassy.

All the pupils and staff were encouraged to dress in seventies attire and  the students put on seventies dance and music performances. A selection of  pupils also re-enacted the very first day of school at the German School  London 50 years ago.

This is the first of several events the German School London has planned to  celebrate their 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary year. [Find out more about the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary celebration events.](https://www.dslondon.org.uk/school-life/social-events/50-years-dsl)

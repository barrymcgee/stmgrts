Richmond Council has commissioned an independent assessment to review the  levels of air pollution in Richmond upon Thames since the implementation of  the 20mph scheme in late 2019 and early 2020. The assessment has now shown  that levels have dropped since the lower speed limit was introduced.

The assessment took place in three locations, Queens Road, St Margarets  Road and Petersham Road, and measured nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels before  the implementation of the scheme and once the scheme had been established.

Data was compared between January - April 2020 (before 20mph in each  location) and January - April 2021 (after 20mph) and showed decreases in  NO2 concentrations of between 13% and 21% in 2021.

Whilst other factors must be considered, particularly the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic on traffic flows, the evidence provides encouraging early  signs that lower speed limits may contribute to lower pollution levels, but  this needs to be monitored further over time.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee for  Richmond Council, said:

> When we proposed 20mph, we made clear that road safety was our primary  rationale and focus. The data we've already had back, shows that average  speeds in this borough reduced across the board and in some cases, we saw  very large speed reductions. 20mph is working.

> We now also have independent figures around air quality and, contrary to  some suggestions that 20mph would worsen the air we breathe, I am pleased  with the progress and confident of the positive contribution the scheme is  making to improving pollution in the borough.'

From 6 February 2020 to 19 March 2020 we held a public consultation on our proposals to make changes at the A316 London Road roundabout in St Margarets, Twickenham. The proposals included measures to improve safety at the roundabout as follows:

- Alterations to the shape of the roundabout as well as resurfacing, to improve safety and facilitate new crossing facilities
- Taking space from the centre of the roundabout to increase the number of traffic lanes to improve safety and allow better lane discipline
- Provision of new signal controlled pedestrian and cycle crossing facilities (Toucans) on the north, west and south arms of the roundabout
- Provision of a new signal controlled Toucan crossing at Cole Park Road
- Reshaping/relocating or removing existing uncontrolled crossings/pedestrian refuges
- Kerb realignment on southern side of the roundabout to accommodate footpath widening and resurfacing
- Appropriate drainage provision and a review of streetlighting

We received 339 responses to the consultation, including six from stakeholders.

Overall, almost two-thirds of respondents thought the changes would make cycling through the area safer, and 80% thought it would make walking safer. The main issues raised were concerns about an additional lane of traffic creating poor lane discipline, concerns about signalised crossings increasing congestion and concerns about shared space provision being unsafe for pedestrians due to cyclist behaviour.

Our responses to issues raised during the consultation can be found in Appendix A of the consultation report: [consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/a316-london-road-roundabout](https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/a316-london-road-roundabout/)

Having considered all the feedback received we have decided to proceed with our proposals with the following modifications:

- We propose to reduce the speed limit along the A316 between Whitton Roundabout and St Margarets roundabout from 40mph to 30pm. This will help reduce vehicle speeds on approach to the new crossings and allow those using the new bus stops to cross the road safely.
- A bus stop west of Cole Park Road implemented since the close of the consultation as part of alterations to the 110 bus route will need to be moved further east to maintain safety and visibility

Although our work on these proposals has been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic we will commence detailed design work in the autumn of 2021 and hope to begin construction on site during spring 2022.

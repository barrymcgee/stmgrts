Parents and carers of school-aged children and young people are invited to a virtual Q and A to ask their questions about the impact of COVID-19 on schools this September, along with any questions about the vaccine rollout for 16-17 year-olds.

Answering questions will be leading experts in the borough, including:

- Dr Patrick Gibson, GP Lead for Richmond upon Thames on the NHS South West London CCG.
- Ian Dodds, Director of Children's Services at Richmond Council.
- Representative from Public Health at Richmond Council.

Parents can register for the events on:

- [26 August from 6.30pm - 8pm](https://covidbriefingschool1.eventbrite.co.uk/)
- [1 September from 6.30pm - 8pm](https://covidbriefingschool2.eventbrite.co.uk/)

At the events, the panel will be talking about the new guidance for schools in the Autumn term and the planned rollout of the vaccine for 16-17 year olds. Attendees will have the opportunity to ask questions to the panel.

The event will be hosted on Zoom. Once registered you will be sent a personal link (around 24 hours in advance and again around 20 minutes before) and will be able to log in and hear and take part in the conversation. Attendees will be invited to have their say via video, audio or text chat.

By registering to the event, participants are [agreeing to the event etiquette](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media//event_guidance_for_attendees_virtual_conversation.pdf).

Ian Dodds, Director of Children's Services for Richmond at Achieving for Children, said:

> "We know that over the past 18 months COVID-19 has caused incredible disruption for our schools and local families. Schools have worked so hard at making sure that children and young people continue to receive high quality education and support.

> "As children return in the new school year, I know that parents will have questions about the arrangements and how they can support their children's schools to make sure that everyone stays safe. Please come along to one of the Q and A and we will try to answer your questions."

Dr Patrick Gibson, GP Lead for Richmond upon Thames on the NHS South West London CCG, added:

> "We have welcomed the JCVI guidance encouraging the vaccination of 16 to 17 year olds and will be making this available to young people as soon as possible across our borough. When you're invited by your GP, please come along. The vaccine really is the best way to build a defence against the virus and protect you and your family and a more normal way of life."

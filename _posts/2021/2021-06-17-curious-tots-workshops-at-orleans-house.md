Make music, move and wiggle at Orleans House Gallery's lively new workshop  classes for pre-walking and toddling children.

Book now for the new Curious Tots workshops which will take place on  Tuesdays throughout the summer.

Guided by an experienced facilitator and artist, each session will feature  a mix of music, storytelling, sensory play and movement to enable you and  your little one to interact and have fun in a relaxed environment.

These events have been designed to support early years skills development  in social interaction and communication as well as nurture curiosity and  creativity.

Marble Hill Adventure Playcentres, Skylarks and OKMT have come together to completely rebuild the Marble Hill Adventure Playground.

Their vision is to create a ground-breaking and unique community hub, formed of local charities working to unlock the magic of community, and magnifying the impact of each charity's work.

It will be a  safe, inclusive, accessible space for indoor and outdoor play, activities and support for mainstream and SEND children and young people and their families. It will harness the power of music and play and be sustainable and harmonious within the heritage and beauty of Marble Hill Park.

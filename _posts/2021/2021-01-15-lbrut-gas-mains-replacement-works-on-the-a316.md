Road users are being advised to plan their journeys in advance following the announcement that Cadent Gas will shortly begin gas mains replacement works on the A316 Great Chertsey Road. The works will commence on Monday, January 25 and will last for approximately 13 weeks.

Gas mains replacement programmes are being carried out by Cadent Gas in order to provide safe and reliable energy to homes and businesses across the borough and aim to reduce the frequency of unplanned repair work to ageing gas pipes.

Cadent Gas have notified Richmond Council of essential work needed to replace and upgrade old large diameter metal gas mains on Great Chertsey Road between Hospital Bridge Roundabout and Apex Corner.

In order to allow for sufficient space for the replacement of pipes located deep beneath the road, and to ensure the safety of both the public and the Cadent Gas workforce, traffic flow will be reduced to a single lane on Great Chertsey Road in both directions. A section of the footpath on Great Chertsey Road will also be closed for the duration of the works.

Cadent Gas have written to all residents directly impacted by the replacement works and will work alongside Richmond Council to minimise the impact on residents.

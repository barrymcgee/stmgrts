Munira delivers on key election pledge to secure additional funding for children with special educational needs in Richmond and Twickenham.

Following intense lobbying from Munira Wilson, MP for Twickenham, and Richmond Council, an agreement has been secured with the Department for Education which is aimed at addressing Richmond's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) funding gap over the course of the next five years.

Commenting on today's announcement, Munira Wilson said:

> "I am delighted to hear the announcement today from the Department for Education of extra funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities. I am really proud to deliver on one of my key election pledges to secure more funding for education locally.

> "I have made it my priority to push the government to support children with SEND in particular. Soon after my election, I secured a debate in Westminster to put forward the plight of Richmond, and many other councils, to the Minister responsible for SEND. As a result, I secured and facilitated a meeting between Richmond councillors and officials, and the Minister, which kickstarted the negotiations.

> "Through hard work and continued pressure in Parliament, we have secured today's positive outcome for some of our most vulnerable children.

> "The multi-year funding agreement will allow the council to invest in additional special needs school places within the borough. It will also help to put the council's overall school financing programme on a sustainable footing and allow them to continue to provide these much need services."

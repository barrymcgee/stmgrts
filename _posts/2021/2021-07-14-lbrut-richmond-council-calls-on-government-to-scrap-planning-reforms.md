Richmond Council has again heavily criticised the Government's proposed  planning 'reforms' in a motion passed by the Full Council last night.

The Government has already introduced a new permitted development right  (PDR) to allow many buildings currently in commercial, business or service  use to be converted to residential use without a formal planning  application. This comes into force on 1 August. In many circumstances  developers will be able to convert shops, nurseries, bars and restaurants  into homes, without reference to local planning policy or the local  community being consulted: through a process called Prior Approval. Without  proper oversight, the Council will be unable to ensure that social  infrastructure and support services are sufficient to support an increase  in people living in an area, or to ensure delivery of the right type of  homes, including affordable housing, or to ensure that those homes are  developed sustainably. Furthermore, change of use to residential without  planning oversight could see the disappearance of commercial and business  premises critical to the recovery and growth of local high streets after  the pandemic.

The Planning White Paper proposes additional steps that would remove the  planning application stage with its legal requirement for community  consultation. It proposes dividing all land into three categories:  protected, renewal and growth to be set out in a new style zonal local  plan. In the last two categories, once a design code has been prepared,  consulted on and agreed, individual development schemes which conform can  be carried out without consultation with or reference to the local  community. Design codes can be very complex and lengthy documents which  include greater flexibility to the developer than a traditional planning  permission. The draft legislation stage for this paper is proposed for  Autumn 2021.

Noting that the Secretary of State recently stated that there is no need to  "rip up the planning system and start again", the Council calls on the  Government to scrap the proposals for planning reform in relation to  plan-making that are contained in the White Paper. It should also undertake  a review of permitted development rights and implement stronger controls on  Ministers' involvement with planning applications and interested parties.

Councillor Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability,  Culture and Sports Committee said:

> "The Council believes that the PDR steps already taken will themselves  undermine the post-pandemic recovery of Richmond upon Thames high streets  and local centres. This will be exacerbated, and the Local Plan and  plan-making process of the borough put at further risk, by the  ill-considered measures proposed in the delayed White Paper.

> "As outlined in the Council motion, we strongly believe that local  authorities, in consultation with residents, businesses, and community  organisations, are best placed to understand the issues specific to their  local area. They must have a say on proposed local developments. The  Government's proposals will curtail local people's ability to influence  development and shape the area where they live.

> "We are open to the proposals for improving the planning system to be more  digital and to offer greater opportunity to engage with local communities  in a transparent and open way. It is critical now that the Government  listens to Local Planning Authorities and rethinks its proposals, which  will undermine the resilience of our high streets and local centres as they  strive to become diverse, vibrant and successful locations once again."

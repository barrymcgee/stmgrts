Godstone Developments Limited who hope to build four homes at the top of Godstone Road are appealing the December 2020 Richmond Council [planning refusal](https://www2.richmond.gov.uk/lbrplanning/Planning_CASENO.aspx?strCASENO=20/2664/FUL) to the Seceratary of State.

*Save The GodWin Trees Residents Group* are fighting the appeal.  Here is a note from them:

> We finally heard at the end of last week that an [Appeal regarding the car-park site has been submitted to the Secretary of State](https://www2.richmond.gov.uk/lbrplanning/Planning_CASENO.aspx?strCASENO=20/2664/FUL&DocTypeID=42#docs).

> The main appeal letter can be found here: [images.richmond.gov.uk/iam/IAMCache/3279432/3279432.pdf](https://images.richmond.gov.uk/iam/IAMCache/3279432/3279432.pdf)

> The letter we received says that all 109 of our objections will be forwarded to the inspector, it also says that we can [make comments or modify our existing representations](https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk) - you must quote the appeal reference **APP/L5810/W/21/3268141** when doing this.

> If your original objections did not include any of the 5 grounds upon which the application was eventually refused (Loss of ancillary industrial/employment space, Character/design, Parking, Affordable housing, Loss of biodiversity/trees) now would be the time to do that.

> It is also worth noting in the appeal letter that the developers are now offering Richmond Council (Point 8 of the Appeal) &pound;546,750 instead of providing affordable housing in their plans together with &pound;80,142 towards the planting of new trees somewhere else - simply outrageous!

Saturday evening saw sparks flying, quite literally, from the heels of the Crossway Pregnancy Crisis Centre team. Accompanied by ten other brave participants, they removed their shoes and socks, rolled up their trousers, and walked barefoot across a path of red-hot burning coals, raising an incredible &pound;2,791 for the charity.

The event, held at St Stephens CE Primary School in Twickenham, is the first of the charity's new 'Fantastic Fundraising Feats' sponsorship events which it will be hosting annually.

> "We wanted to bring a bit of daring and excitement to the local fundraising scene, the firewalk has certainly done a good job in setting the bar! We'll be organising an equally challenging fundraising event every year and aiming to build a following of people that are up for tapping into their inner thrill-seeker!", Fay Hamilton, Centre Director.

Crossway help people make healthy relationships, sex, and pregnancy choices and provide support during pregnancy and after pregnancy loss. Fay continues, "We are delighted to have raised such an impressive amount from this event. Just to put it into context, &pound;2791 will allow us to offer our 10 step pregnancy loss program to 20 individual clients, so I'd like to say a huge thank you to everyone that took part and supported us".

There were also generous raffle donations from local restaurants Le Salon Prive and Del Posto and refreshments kindly provided by Aldi and Tesco.

#### DEEP Events - Sunday 31 January (5pm GMT)

Since January, Andrew has joined forces with Soulhub to help us refocus on what's important, and that is helping others understand themselves and share their stories. Building on the success of Soulhub Journal The Collective launch, we've created monthly online (one day they'll be in-person!) DEEP events.

Think TED talks and Royal Variety Show fused together - Our first Special Guests are former Chief of Staff to Oprah Libby Moore, Abi Flynn and Bradley Wescott. Abi was told she had 3 weeks to live from cancer and has since gone on to have a family and transform her life.

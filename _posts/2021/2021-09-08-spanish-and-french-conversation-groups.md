Now that schools are back, why not join a friendly, local conversation group for adults to improve or perfect their Spanish or French?

I am a bilingual, Oxford scholar, with over 15 years of experience in language education.

I run adult conversation classes in French, Spanish and English, from lower-intermediate to advanced level, with maximum six per group. Due to popular demand, I have built up to eight regular groups, who choose to look at current affairs, literature, grammar, or a mixture, all with increasing confidence and fluency.

There are limited spaces in person or on Zoom (only during office hours), so please contact me if you are interested.

If you're worried that language learning is only for children, [here's one of the countless studies proving the opposite](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2NsHY4MhL95FgclByxS1XRl/can-learning-a-new-language-boost-your-brain)

Please email or call for more information or to speak to a current student.

York House and York House Gardens in Twickenham have been restored for residents and visitors to enjoy.

Over the years, the building's original window shutters had become tired and the 'Naked Ladies' marble statues in York House Gardens had become discoloured due to algae growth. Richmond Council used the recent lockdown as an opportunity to carry out repair and restoration work to York House and the Gardens.

The 'Naked Ladies' statues were first acquired in 1909 and are made from Italian marble. The statues include giant sea horses, seashells, sea nymphs and a central female figure. They sit in the riverside gardens of York House and are open for the public to enjoy.

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sports Committee, said:

> "York House Gardens date back to the 17<sup>th</sup> Century and offer visitors a wonderful place to relax and explore.

> "The pandemic showed us just how important the borough's parks and open spaces are for people wanting to be outside in the comfort of nature. It's great to see York House and Gardens carefully and beautifully restored. Thank you to all who have worked to achieve this."

Park Lane Stables RDA (Riding for the Disabled) has been a key part of the Teddington community for many years, providing much-needed therapy and happiness to hundreds of local children and adults with (and without) disabilities every year.

However, our landlord has told us that he will not be renewing our lease which ends on 31 May 2021 as he wishes to sell the property.

We don't want our lose our beloved stables. We love our unique home in Teddington and we want to stay and serve our amazing community. We are a small charity and we have struggled to survive the COVID-19 crisis, but the overwhelming support we have received from the local community has helped us through this and made us strong.

Please help us stay in Park Lane, Teddington!

We urgently need to raise &pound;1M through crowdfunding so we can buy Park Lane Stables on behalf of the community.

This is an 'All-or-Nothing' campaign, so if we don't achieve our target all your pledges will be returned to you at the end of the campaign and will be held securely by Crowd Funder for the duration of the campaign.

We need to stay in our current home so our participants without sight can get to us on public transport.  If we were tucked away in a different location those that need us most would not be able to reach us and would become more socially isolated.  We are a social hub for many adults with additional needs who come to the stables for a horsey fix, be that riding, carriage driving, grooming, jobs around the yard or just sharing secrets with their trusted four legged friends.

With your support, we can make this our forever home and our participants will know their safe space will always be available to them.

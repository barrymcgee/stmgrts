Following funding from Richmond Council's Local Area Fund, local creatives  have collaborated to produce the short film 'Tears Dry To Frost'. Starring  Anastasia Martin, the film is about how, as she endures more turbulence  from her partner, a young woman realises the need to liberate herself.

Project-lead Alexandra Shaw and the team strive to raise awareness of the  nuances of emotional abuse in relationships through this creative medium.  Such harm cannot really be seen; by channelling the powers of cinema,  attention can be drawn to that which is often overlooked, at least.

Funding from Richmond Council's [Local Area Fund](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/voluntary_and_community_sector/voluntary_and_community_sector_support/grants_and_funding/local_area_fund) has enabled the team's endeavour to initiate more reflection, discourse,  and action on this issue: improving health and wellbeing, and bringing a  constructive positive difference to the community.

Tears Dry To Frost' is due to premiere on 22 October at The Exchange,  Twickenham, followed with a talk on the issues it raises by an experienced  qualified psychotherapist and relationships councillor.

The audience will then be invited to enjoy live music by local musician  Isabella Luca and refreshments by local Zoran's Delicatessen. The team very  much look forward to sharing this evening with the local community, and to  the project's progressions ahead.

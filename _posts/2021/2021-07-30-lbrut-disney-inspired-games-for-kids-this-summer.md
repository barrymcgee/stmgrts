This summer, Public Health England has partnered with Disney to help get  kids active in the school holidays by playing 10 minute Shake Up games. The  Shake Up games are inspired by favourite characters from Frozen, Toy Story  and Marvel.

Physical activity is associated with improved personal health, social, and  academic outcomes, as well as being beneficial to kids' mental wellbeing.  Children and young people should achieve a total of at least 60 minutes of  moderate to vigorous physical activity everyday, but many are not reaching  this recommendation.

The 10 Minute Shake Ups break the 60 minutes into manageable chunks for  both kids and adults, making it both achievable and fun. Access the [Shake Up games](https://www.nhs.uk/10-minute-shake-up/shake-ups) and help the young people in your life be active and have fun this summer.

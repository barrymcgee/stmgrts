Zipcar, the car-sharing company, has expanded its car rental club to  several new areas in the north of the borough. Zipcar Flex gives residents  easy access to a car when they need one without having to own a vehicle.

From today (Thursday 8 July 2021) designated Zipcars will be available for  one-way hires within the Flex operating area which will include Richmond,  Kew, East Sheen, Mortlake and Barnes.

Zipcar already operates in the borough from dedicated parking bays, but  Zipcar Flex will make the service more accessible  as the car does not need  to be returned to the same parking bay at the end of each booking. Zipcar  Flex intends to expand into the rest of the borough as usage grows in the  operating area.

Zipcar Flex cars can be parked in any residential or shared use parking  bays within the Zipcar operating zone. Zipcar Flex will also include a  substantial number of pure electric vehicles, giving residents the  opportunity to try electric vehicles and help improve local air quality.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee,  said:

> "Car clubs are an important and convenient solution for residents as we aim  to reduce unnecessary car usage within the borough, especially for short  journeys. Car sharing contributes to lower levels of local air pollution  and traffic congestion.

> "Additionally, over time the successful implementation of car sharing  schemes can reduce parking pressure in local areas as some residents may  choose to give up their personal cars in favour of more flexible solutions."

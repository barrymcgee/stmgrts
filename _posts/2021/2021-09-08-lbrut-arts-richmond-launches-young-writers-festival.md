Arts Richmond has launched their annual writing competition for all young people in the borough. The competition runs from Wednesday 1 September until Friday 3 December 2021.

Arts Richmond Young Writers' Festival is open to all young people who either live or attend school/clubs in the Borough of Richmond upon Thames.  It is a chance to demonstrate writing skills of any form: stories,  descriptive writing, poems, playlets, lyrics for songs - whatever the imagination can devise.

Entries are judged in four age groups with prizes for all winning entries.  In addition, Arts Richmond appoints a Junior and Senior Laureate who will be given opportunities during the following year to write about events taking place in the borough, for possible publication.

All shortlisted entrants will be invited to a gala awards event in a  prestigious venue in spring 2022.

#### Entry rules are simple

- Entrants may write about any subject of their choice, in any format (e.g. a poem, story, play script, news item etc.) not exceeding 500 words or 25 lines for a poem
- Entries must be typed (handwritten entries will be disqualified).
- Extracts from longer pieces will be accepted. All entries must be exclusively the entrant's own work.

#### Entries will be judged in the following categories:

- School years 4 and under
- School years 5 and 6
- School years 7 to 9
- School years 10 and over

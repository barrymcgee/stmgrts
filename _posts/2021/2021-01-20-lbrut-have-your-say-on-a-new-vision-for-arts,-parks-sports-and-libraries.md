Help the Council develop a ten-year vision and set of priorities for its cultural services - including arts, parks, sports and libraries.

The value of arts, parks, sports and libraries in improving the lives of residents has never been so recognised as during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new ten-year vision for culture will help the borough come back stronger with an innovative and diverse cultural offering to empower and inspire all residents.

By having your say and filling out the survey, you will help us understand what is most important to residents over the next ten years. The survey explores what you understand 'culture' to be, how and why you use the borough's cultural services and reasons why you might not use these services.

[Fill out the survey online](https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/richmondecs/culture-20/). You can request a paper copy of the survey by emailing  [consultation@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:consultation@richmond.gov.uk)

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sports Services Committee, said:

> "The borough's cultural offering is integral to supporting residents' mental and physical wellbeing. We hope to deliver a diverse cultural vision that ensures all residents are able and inspired to use our services.

> "The pandemic will have changed the way many people view arts, parks, sports and libraries - perhaps you've realised just how important some of these services are to you or perhaps you've got ideas as to how they can be improved. Whatever it is, now is your chance to share these views!

> "We would love to hear from as many people as possible. Please fill out the form and encourage others to do the same. Thank you."

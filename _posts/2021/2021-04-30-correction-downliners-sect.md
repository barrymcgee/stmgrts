A recent article in the newsletter about local and legendary R&B band the Downliners Sect included a brief paragraph about some of their future gigs including one in May at the 100 Club, Oxford Street, an important blues and R&B venue in the 1960s.

Unfortunately because of recent COVID restrictions some of these dates have been changed or cancelled. This is how the current Sect date book looks…

- **Thursday 24th June** -  Eel Pie Club, The Cabbage Patch in Twickenham. Members of the Sect will be playing with the Eel Pie All Stars.
- **Sunday 1st August** -  Barmy Arms, Twickenham Riverside. Members of the Sect will be playing with the Eel Pie All Stars.
- **Thursday 20th January 2022** - 100 Club, 100 Oxford St – the Downliners Sect themselves... amps turned up to 11!

We will advise you of any future changes in date or venue.

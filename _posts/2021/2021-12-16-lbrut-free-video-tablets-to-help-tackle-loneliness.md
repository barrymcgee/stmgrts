Do you know someone who might benefit from an easy-to-use video communication tablet, so that they can stay connected with their loved ones and/or carers this Christmas?

In partnership with Alcove, Richmond Council is continuing to provide Alcove Video Carephone devices for free to people who might need virtual care and health and wellbeing support. The Alcove Carephone is suitable for those who have little to no technological experience and can be used to make video calls with family, friends, care workers and other approved service providers.

The Carephones are installed with the user's key contacts and the user can then easily make video calls by pressing on a person's face. They can also be used to schedule messages or reminders, such as medication reminders or memory prompts.

To find out more, or to refer someone you know who you think would benefit from an Alcove Video Carephone, please email [digitalsupport@richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk](mailto:digitalsupport@richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk).

You can also listen to this [podcast episode](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/news/podcast/podcast_archive/podcast_2021/podcast_technology_and_the_future_of_care) with a member from the Alcove team talking in detail about the Video Carephones.

Cllr Piers Allen, Lead Member for Adult Social Care and Health and Chair of the Health & Wellbeing Board, said:

> "Technology has been vitally important in keeping people connected throughout the pandemic. Alcove Video Carephones have already been shown to make huge difference to people who might be feeling lonely, as well as helping them feel and stay safe and independent in their homes.

> "If you know of anyone who you think would benefit from a Carephone, please do get in touch so that they can be supported."

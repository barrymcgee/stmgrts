*A quick update on the exciting events coming up at the Museum this summer and autumn.*

Throughout August we will be running Curator's Tours every Wednesday and Saturday at 2pm. The tours are FREE and there is no need to book - just head to the Museum's reception at 2pm where you will be met by a member of the Museum Team who will share with you their favourite objects in the collection.

We are delighted to let you all know that [tickets for the Garden Party at Trumpeters' House are now available](https://museum-of-richmond.arttickets.org.uk/the-museum-of-richmond/2021-09-18-trumpeters-house-garden-party?t=717)!

On Saturday 25 September the Museum will also be running family friendly workshops as part of the Totally Thames Festival. Come along and discover foreshore finds from the Thames and learn about mudlarking and river archaeology with the Museum team. Children and accompanying adults will have opportunity to handle intriguing museum objects found nearby in the river Thames and try out their archaeological skills. See related river-finds from the Museum's own collection - including coins, a mace head; even a fossilised mammoth's tooth - and learn about their fascinating history. These [workshops are FREE](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/foreshore-finds-at-the-museum-of-richmond-tickets-162315938341) but places are limited.

Throughout the Autumn we will also be running craft workshops for adults. We are delighted to be working with the team from Works of Love, from The Vineyard. Each month we will be exploring the story behind a beautifully crafted object in the Museum's collection, then the friendly and experienced Works of Love Team will show you how to start your own projects, including embroidery and patchwork. The workshops are free and you will even be given a FREE goody bag of materials to help you continue crafting at home, as well as tea, coffee and snacks during a chance to chat with like-minded crafters. [Booking is essential](https://museum-of-richmond.arttickets.org.uk/the-museum-of-richmond/2021-09-08-coffee-and-crafting) as places are limited.

In October we will be running more Curator's Tours, every Wednesday and Saturday, which will focus on objects and stories related to the King's Observatory, both in the exhibition and in the Museum's displays. As with the August tours, these tours are FREE and there is no need to book - just head to the Museum's reception at 2pm.

The 13<sup>th</sup> Twickenham (St Mary's) Scout group is the oldest scout group in Twickenham and has been running for over 110 years.  It has its own headquarters in Seymour Gardens, Twickenham.  We are an active and flourishing group with no shortage of children wanting to join, but are now in need of more adult help.

We are looking for a new leader for our Scouts section as our Scout leader who has been with us for 12 years is retiring in July. Scouts meet on Fridays between 7.30pm and 9pm and are aged 10&#189; to 14&#189; and is open to girls and boys. The current Scout leader is assisted by another leader and also sometimes with a student.

We run a fantastic mix of activities for the Scouts, including orienteering, riffle shooting, outdoor cooking, Burns Night Supper, swimming, bowling, walking holidays, Summer Camps and more recently cooking, knotting and quizzes over Zoom.  There is also an Executive Committee which supports the leaders and ensures the scout hut is well-maintained.

Scouting actively engages young people and empowers them to make a positive contribution to society.  Leaders and assistant leaders can be any age, from any walk of life.  A parent or grandparent with children in the scouting movement (leaders' children of course get priority if they need places in our group).  Someone with time on their hands looking for a way to get involved in the community.  Or someone who has been involved in Scouting as a youngster and wants to get back into it as an adult. The only requirements are that they are over 18 and can make the sessions most of the time.

If this is of interest to you or you'd like to find out more, please contact Maggie Vivian on 07967 597757 or  [maggie.vivian@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:maggie.vivian@hotmail.co.uk).  Or, if you know someone who might be interested, please do pass this on. While some previous experience often helps, it is by no way essential.  You will be supported by an experienced team and training is readily available, uniform provided but no pay.

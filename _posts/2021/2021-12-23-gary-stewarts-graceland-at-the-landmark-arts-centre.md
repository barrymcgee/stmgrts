Legendary troubadour Gary Stewart (Gary Stewart Band/Hope and Social) and his incredible six piece band recreate Paul Simon's landmark Graceland album in all its glory in next month in Teddington.

Expect to hear those magical songs, with their captivating stories, distinctive harmonies and South African rhythms brought to life in front of you with no detail spared; from the layers of guitars and percussion, right down to the legendary bass solos and maybe even some token dance moves - if you're lucky!

Gary Stewart's Graceland will take place on Friday 14 January 2022. Doors and the bar will open at 7.15pm with the show beginning at 8pm.

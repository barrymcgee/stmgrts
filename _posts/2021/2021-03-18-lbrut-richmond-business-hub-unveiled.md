Richmond upon Thames is an entrepreneurial borough with a diverse local economy, characterised by a high proportion of small independent businesses and a large number of self-employed residents.

Many local businesses have suffered due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With the vaccination rollout continuing across the borough, many businesses are currently preparing to re-open next month while others continue to operate remotely.

The Richmond Business Hub has been launched by Richmond Council to support local businesses and those self-employed in the borough.

The Richmond Business Hub can offer businesses:

- support for businesses looking to alter their operations as a result of the pandemic
- support programmes including webinars to help businesses reach their full potential
- Information, guidance and support for a range of business sectors
- Information, guidance and support specifically for female entrepreneurs
- Information regarding funding and financing
- support for start-up businesses and start up plans
- guidance for buying or selling internationally
- peer to peer support from other local businesses
- business courses available include The Phoenix Enterprise Programme, and the Small Business Accelerator.
- webinars to allow entrepreneurs to learn and develop key skills on -line
- a range of useful tools and links to resources to help you grow your business

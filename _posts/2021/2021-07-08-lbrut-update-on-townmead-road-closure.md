Richmond Council will be closing bookings for Townmead Road Household Waste  and Recycling Centre until further notice while a plan for partial  reopening is finalised. All current bookings will be cancelled and  residents will be notified via email. The extended closure is required  following a major fire in one of the site's sheds on Sunday, 20 June.

Further to safety inspections completed at the end of last week, the  Council is now clear on the full extent of the works needed to make the  shed safe and compliant for re-opening. Unfortunately that means that part  of the site must remain closed for longer than anticipated. The Council is  now drawing up plans to partially re-open the site, with a reduced  capacity, in a way that is safe for both the public and site staff.

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture  and Sports Committee said:

> "I know it is frustrating for residents that Townmead Road has been closed  for this long, and that people have had multiple bookings cancelled, but  safety has always been our priority. I am pleased we now have a clear view  of what needs to be done and plan to get the site operational as soon as  possible.

> "Unfortunately capacity will be reduced for a time, therefore there will be  fewer slots available once the booking site reopens, so I would still  encourage people to think of alternative options in the interim such as  using the bulky waste collection service or visiting one of the other West  London sites. I would also ask that people think about [how they can reduce their or store their recycling and waste](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/news/partner_comment_spot/partner_comment_spot_archive/partner_comment_spot_2020/new_blog_reducing_your_waste_during_coronavirus_crisis) until they are able to visit Townmead Road again.

> "Please also keep an eye on the [Townmead Road section](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/townmead_road) of the Council website for updates on the reopening."

### Booking at an alternative site

Whilst the centre is closed, waste can be taken to other West London recycling sites in Hounslow, Ealing and Brent.

You must book to visit one of these sites - a prior booking for Townmead Road does not  guarantee you entry.

Different sites have different terms and conditions and there may be  charges for certain types of waste. Check details thoroughly before booking  your visit.

You can book at:

- [Brent](https://westlondonwaste.gov.uk/recycling-sites/brent/)
- [Ealing - Greenford and Acton](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201171/recycling_services/292/re-use_and_recycling_centres_and_sites/1)
- [Hounslow](https://www.hounslow.gov.uk/info/20017/space_waye_re-use_and_recycling_centre)

Please note: Richmond residents are unable to use the Wandsworth and  Kingston tips as they are in a different greater London waste authority  area.

You can also [book a bulky waste collection](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/waste_and_recycling/bulky_items_and_other_waste_collections/book_a_bulky_item_collection) for some items. Do not leave items on the street - this is fly-tipping,  which is a serious crime and could lead to large fines.

The mobile PCR testing facility based at Old Deer Park in Richmond is now seven days a week. As levels of COVID-19 remain high in the borough, we want to make it as easy as possible for local people to get tested.

To access a test at this centre, and the centres at Bramble Lane in Hampton or Broom Road in Teddington, you [must book an appointment](https://www.nhs.uk/coronavirus). Test appointments are available to book for those with Coronavirus symptoms. These include a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste.

PCR testing is also available for those who have tested positive via a lateral flow test, or have been asked to get a test, either by NHS Test and Trace if they're a close contact of a positive case, or a clinician or their local authority.

Tests can be booked on the new NHS Covid-19 app, online: [nhs.uk/coronavirus](https://www.nhs.uk/coronavirus) or by calling 119. If there are none available, please continue to check online.

All three PCR testing sites in the borough are easily accessible without a car. Those being tested will be required to follow public health measures, including social distancing, not travelling by taxi or public transport, practicing good personal hygiene and wearing a face covering throughout, including while travelling to and from the testing centre.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "We know that with COVID-19 levels being so high in Richmond, and it being the final lead up to Christmas, there is huge demand on testing across the country.

> "We are working hard to ensure that there is enough locally, and these additional days will help with the pressure.

> "Finding cases and asking these people to self-isolate is key to breaking the chain of transmission, so we can keep Richmond upon Thames safe.

> "It remains vital that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms gets tested."

We also know that there is national demand for lateral flow tests, with people keen to test before seeing friends and family at Christmas.

At the moment we are trying hard to ensure that East Sheen, Hampton, Twickenham and Whitton libraries have tests for people to come and collect. However, demand is very high. We are hoping our stocks will be replenished in the coming days.

The national website is regularly refreshed, with daily stocks arriving for people to [request online](https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests). However, we ask that residents do not 'stock pile' tests. There are seven tests in a box.

Do you need a secure space to store your bicycle close to your home? Apply for a space in a bike hangar.

Earlier this year Richmond Council asked residents for their views on where to locate new bicycle hangars following requests from residents for more storage facilities. Following feedback from residents, the Council agreed the [new locations of the bike hangars](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/roads_and_transport/active_travel/bikehangars).

A single hangar can safely and securely store up to six bikes and is accessed by people who have signed up to the scheme, paid a membership fee and been given a key. Spaces cost &pound;72 a year which covers the management and maintenance of the hangar.

Residents interested in hiring a parking space for their bicycle can [register their interest](https://www.cyclehoop.rentals/).

Richmond Council will open the next round of consultations for new bike hangars in early 2022. Residents can [request a bike hangar](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/roads_and_transport/active_travel/bikehangars) in a location convenient to them.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee, said:

> "We are continuing to make it easier for residents to use their bicycles and choose active travel options.

> "We have already received a large volume of requests from residents who would like to see a bike hangar on their street and the next phase of our consultation allows residents to request a hangar at a location convenient to them.

> "Renting a space in a bike hangar is a convenient solution for those living in flats or properties without adequate storage space for bicycles. I hope residents will take the opportunity to let us know the locations convenient to them."

Marathon Kids UK is a free programme that runs in parks all over the UK on  weekends and in the school holidays, allowing children to maintain regular  exercise even when school's out.

Marathon Kids UK meet on the first Saturday of every month from 9 to 10 am  in Marble Hill Park.

Inspiring the next generation to become physically active, they believe  that running has the power to show kids they can achieve more than they  ever dreamed possible!

Events run by Marathon Kids are free and open to all regardless of age or  ability so join them for fun activity games, relays and an endurance run.

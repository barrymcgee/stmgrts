Richmond Council has announced that it will be joining the London-wide Solar Together scheme. The scheme gives residents the opportunity to buy high quality solar panels at a discounted rate through a group buying scheme, helping to reduce their carbon footprint while making savings on household bills.

Richmond Council are working in partnership with the Mayor of London to make the transition to clean energy as cost effective and hassle-free as possible. Supporting the Solar Together initiative is one of many activities Richmond Council is delivering to tackle the climate emergency.

The scheme allows residents to benefit from significant reductions in the cost price of new solar panel systems through group buying with others who are interested in making the switch to renewable energy.

This innovative scheme builds on three years of the highly successful Solar Together programme run across the UK which has delivered over 3,000 installations to date (including nearly 1,000 in London) and almost 50,000 tonnes of avoided lifetime carbon emissions.

The installation of solar panels will enable households to generate their own clean electricity, significantly reducing both household bills and overall carbon footprint.

Once registered, residents will receive support and advice throughout the process. Residents will receive personalised recommendations depending on their house type and the specifications of individual roofs.

Installation works will be carried out by a certified technician to ensure residents receive a high quality of work on their homes.

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sports Services Committee said:

> "Many residents have told us that they want to make the move to renewable energy but feel that the process is overwhelming. This scheme will support residents along the way, helping to make the purchase and installation process cheaper and easier.

> "Supporting residents to make this transition is an important part of our Climate Emergency Strategy. I hope many of you see this as an opportunity to look seriously at solar energy production for your home."

Registration for the Solar Together scheme is now open. The closing date to register is Tuesday 23 March 2021.

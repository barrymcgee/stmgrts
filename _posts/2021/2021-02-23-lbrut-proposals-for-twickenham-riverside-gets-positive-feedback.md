The Leader of Richmond Council, Cllr Gareth Roberts, has welcomed the overwhelmingly positive response to the recent consultation held on the latest version of the plans for Twickenham Riverside.

Cllr Roberts said:

> "I'm delighted that so many people shared their views on the latest proposals and I'm incredibly pleased that the results were so positive. These results reinforce what we've been hearing from residents for years; that they want a beautiful, car free park on the banks of the Thames which will act as the destination attraction Twickenham Riverside so richly deserves."

Topline feedback from the consultation showed that more than half of those asked said they would be more likely to visit an improved Twickenham Riverside and a further third said they'd continue visiting Twickenham Riverside.

Over the past twelve months, Hopkins Architects and their team, with help from the Council, have been working hard to develop the design for the Twickenham Riverside site. This follows a design competition held in 2019.

The scheme will deliver housing (including affordable homes), office space, shops, a caf&#233; and pub/restaurant and plenty of open space. This open space includes relocating the Diamond Jubilee Gardens into the centre of the proposed development, with suggestions for event space, an exciting children's play area and p&#233;tanque pitches as well as terraced lawns, planting and trees.  The proposal also includes public open space along the Embankment with a flexible events space and a widened Water Lane with inviting views from King Street.

Earlier this year, residents were asked their views on the proposals - and 829 people took the opportunity to have their say.

Whilst the results are still being analysed - top line results show that:

- 89% of people who took part in the consultation visit Twickenham Riverside regularly (Daily / Weekly / Monthly)
- 84% of people who took part in the consultation said that they would be either more likely or just as likely to visit the Riverside after the redevelopment (54% more likely).
- 73% of people agree that the proposed development achieves the ambition of high-quality open space and pedestrianised priority.

An additional engagement programme was carried out with children and young people, largely through contact with local schools. Around 310 children and young people were engaged either via online sessions or with a recorded presentation and questionnaire.

Cllr Roberts added:

> "Twickenham deserves so much more than the current site. This is a proposal that looks to the future. Engaging with young people is vital to ensure we create a Twickenham that is fit for future generations. We need to be ambitious and brave and think about the legacy that this site will have.

> "Whilst we are still digesting all the feedback - I look forward to working with the Architect to create a final design that even more people can support."

A report with the full results will be published on the Council website in the coming weeks.

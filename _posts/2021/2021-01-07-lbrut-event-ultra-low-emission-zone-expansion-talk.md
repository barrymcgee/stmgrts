Richmond Council is hosting an event to give residents the chance to hear from Transport for London on the London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) expansion.

The expansion of the zone on 25 October 2021 will extend the zone up to (but not including) the South Circular Road and will mean numerous homes and businesses in Kew, Barnes and Mortlake will be within the zone, as well as anyone driving through it. Mortlake Crematorium and the borough's Household Re-use and Recycling Centre, Townmead Road, will also be in the expanded zone.

Residents can join the online Community Conversation on Monday 1 February to hear from representatives from TfL and the Council. Residents will be able to ask questions about the implications of the scheme and how best to prepare. The Community Conversation will take place on Zoom from 6.30pm -8.00pm. Registration is essential. [Register online](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/community-conversation-tfl-ulez-expansion-tickets-135677185113)

The ULEZ operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with a &pound;12.50 daily charge for vehicles that do not meet the required emissions standards. [Information about the standards (including a vehicle checker)](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone).

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee, said:

> "We are committed to improving air quality in Richmond upon Thames, but the Mayor of London's ULEZ boundary is one we have strenuously challenged, because of the arbitrary dividing line it places within our communities.

> "The proposed ULEZ boundary includes Mortlake Crematorium and the Townmead Road Recycling Centre.  In both these cases, residents with non-compliant vehicles, who live outside the zone, will have to pay the &pound;12.50 daily charge every time they want to visit Townmead Road.

> "The event on 1 February is a chance to ask questions and to share any concerns. Please register for the virtual event and I will see you there."

Have your say on a new scheme of contraflow cycling routes to support a  convenient, accessible and safe cycling network in Richmond upon Thames.

Have your say on a new scheme of contraflow cycling routes to support a  convenient, accessible and safe cycling network in Richmond upon Thames.

Contraflow cycling is when cyclists are allowed to ride against the traffic flow on a one-way street, and will encourage more people to use bicycles when making local journeys.

The proposed areas for contraflow cycling schemes are:

- St Margarets and North Twickenham: Sidney Road, Kenley Road, Broadway Avenue, Hill View Road, Bridge Road
- North Richmond: Kingsway East, Kingsway West, Shalstone Road
- Hampton Wick: Park Road

The [consultation page](https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/richmondecs/contraflow-21/), where you can share your comments, has detailed drawings of each area and  an overall plan of the routes. The consultation closes on 26 July 2021.

Richmond Council is continuously working to improve the borough's cycling  provision to support its [Active Travel Strategy](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/roads_and_transport/active_travel/cycling_strategy). Last year, it installed the borough's first protected cycle lane on Kew  Road and in the last six months, the route has seen an increase in usage of  82% based on the weekly average of cycle users.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee for  Richmond Council, said:

> "We declared a climate emergency in July 2019 with one of our key  commitments being to change how people travel within the borough. Cycling  trips should be convenient, accessible and safe so that more people adopt  cycling as a clean and sustainable mode of transport.

> "Contraflow cycling routes will help us achieve this by opening up the  street network and providing safe short-cuts for cyclists. It gives cycling  an advantage over driving, encouraging people to jump on their bikes when  making short local journeys. It will also mean less cyclists are tempted to  take to the pavements to avoid having to go down busy and longer  alternative routes, making cycling safer for everyone.

> "The Kew Road statistics prove investing in improving cycling  infrastructure results in more people making journeys by bike and we hope  installing contraflow cycling routes does the same, so please take the time  to share your views by filling in the consultation."

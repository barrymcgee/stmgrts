    We all want to scream at the top of our lungs at what's happening around us - but we also don't want our neighbours to phone the police. So, the healthy alternative? Vocalise. Express. Learn to use your voice and empower yourself.

In this precarious moment, we are all feeling isolated, disempowered, frustrated.

A St Margarets resident, I am a Guildhall and Royal Academy of Music trained singer and I teach the original Italian school of singing. The famous Bel Canto. And let me tell you, these days, it's better than therapy.

We all want to scream at the top of our lungs at what's happening around us - but we also don't want our neighbours to phone the police. So, the healthy alternative? Vocalise. Express. Learn to use your voice and empower yourself.

Try a lesson (I can work with your budget in these trying times - just ask). No judgment. It's for you. Your time. Your own personal form of expressing your fears, your frustrations - and cheaper than a therapist. So empower yourself. SING!

Lessons available Monday - Sunday from 11am to 8pm.

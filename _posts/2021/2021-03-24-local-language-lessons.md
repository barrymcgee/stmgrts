Bonjour. Hola. Hooray. Youpi. Hurra. Now the kids or grandchildren are back at school, why don't you too learn, refresh or perfect a language?

I run local, friendly adult conversation classes in French, Spanish and English, from lower-intermediate to advanced level, with a maximum of six per group. Due to popular demand, I have built up to eight regular groups, who choose to look at current affairs, literature, grammar, or a mixture, all with increasing confidence and fluency.

There are limited spaces in person or on Zoom (only during office hours), so please contact me if you are interested at [www.live-languages.com/home](https://www.live-languages.com/home)

If you're worried that language learning is only for children, [here's one of countless studies proving the opposite](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2NsHY4MhL95FgclByxS1XRl/can-learning-a-new-language-boost-your-brain).

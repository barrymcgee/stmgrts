Richmond residents are being urged not let their guards down after the  Government delayed the easing of lockdown restrictions until 19 July.

Last night, the Prime Minister announced that due to the rise in cases, and  concerns around the faster spreading DELTA variant of concern, he would  delay the further easing of lockdown measures until 19 July.

Responding to the announcement, Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond  Council, said:

> "I know the delay in easing all the COVID-19 restrictions will be a huge  disappointment to all those who have been looking forward to life returning  to normal and particularly to people whose livelihoods continue to be  affected. We remain resolute that the Government must step-up and provide  support for all those businesses who are seeing a financial loss due to the  ongoing restrictions.

> "However, with our COVID numbers on the rise, and our surrounding boroughs  having to go through surge testing, there is no other choice. The DELTA  variant is virulent.

> "Whilst we can be very pleased with progress in vaccinating people in  Richmond, we haven't got to the point where enough people are vaccinated to  control this new variant fully.

> "If you have symptoms, you and your household must isolate, and you must  have a PCR test. If you are a close contact of someone who tests positive,  you also need to isolate.

> "Remember that you can have COVID-19 and spread it to others while having  few or no symptoms yourself. This makes it important that everyone takes  advantage of the free lateral flow tests that are available and take a test  twice a week to make sure they are not carrying and spreading the virus.

> "Everyone in Richmond has worked incredibly hard over the months to help  keep the virus under control and it would be a huge shame to see all these  efforts go to waste by relaxing the restrictions a few weeks too early."

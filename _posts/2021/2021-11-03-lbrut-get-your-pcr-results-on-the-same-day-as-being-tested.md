For the next two weeks, those who take a COVID-19 PCR test at the pop-up testing centre at Old Deer Park will receive their results on the same day.

A mobile COVID-19 processing unit will join the PCR mobile testing unit at Old Deer Car Park on 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 November, as part of the Council's commitment to keeping residents safe.

This will mean attendees will get their PCR results on the same day they take their test. London has only 3-5 mobile processing units at present and Richmond Council has been chosen to host these pop-up events.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "Our case rate is still very high, showing us that COVID-19 is still an unwanted guest in our borough. One of the ways we can curb the spread is to get tested and isolate.

> "For those who have had a positive lateral flow test or are displaying symptoms, it is important that you isolate straight away and book an urgent PCR test. Having a processing unit at the Old Deer Park testing centre, will mean tests won't need to be taken off site and people will have their results on the same day."

Residents are reminded that the service is for pre-booked appointments only, but tests can be booked up to 24 hours in advance. Please only book an appointment if you have any [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/) or have a positive lateral flow test.

If you wish to register for an appointment, you can do so using the links below:

- [Register for an essential worker test](https://self-referral.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/antigen/essential-worker)
- [Register for a non-essential worker test](https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test)

Those attending are asked to follow the instructions provided. Signage will also be in place to help direct attendees. Please note, these are PCR testing and processing units.

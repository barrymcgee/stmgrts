  The St Margarets Community Website was started in 2005 and over the past 16 years I have been publishing this site regularly, but as a new year begins, I feel this is the right time to start closing down the site.

The St Margarets Community Website was started in 2005. Over the past 16 years, I have regularly published this site with over 3,800 articles, 6,500 events, and 690 newsletters. But as a new year begins, I feel this is the right time to start closing down the site.

There is no single reason, just a general sense that the timing is right. I have mostly enjoyed creating the site and supporting the community that I live in; however, I feel the effort has now tipped over the benefits it brings. There are now far better online resources for everything that I provide. And, before you ask, no one will be taking the site over.

I need to thank two people in particular for help with the site. The first is Simon Chapman, the former owner of Cutters and Gift and when I moved to the UK, head of the St Margarets Traders Association. He encouraged me with the site, helped with a lot of the early content, and helped promote the site with stickers on shop doors, offering me space at the Crown Road fairs and more.

The second person is Martyn Day, one of the most remarkable people I have had the pleasure to know. I met Martyn when he was the Cub Scout leader for my boys in 1st St Margarets. He quickly offered to send me a regular [article for the website on a range of topics from local history to local bands to local events](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=011552492105320257021:aklyesuuk5c&cof=FORID:0&q=martyn day). His pieces are timeless and still bring thousands of visitors to the site everyday.

I haven't exactly decided how to archive the site, but I will try to keep some bits of it online, at least for a while. But from now, I will stop updating the site.

Thank you for your support.

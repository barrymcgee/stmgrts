The full catalogue of artwork and artists' biographies are available to view ahead of the sale on our website.

Our Secret Art Sale takes place ONLINE 10am Saturday 25<sup>th</sup> - 10pm on Wednesday 29<sup>th</sup> September 2021.

All artworks are exhibited anonymously on the event website and sold for &pound;40 each on a first come, first served basis. This enables buyers to purchase art they like at an affordable price, whilst offering them the chance of owning work by a renowned artist or celebrity. Only when the art is sold it the name of the artist revealed.

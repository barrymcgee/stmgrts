Long time local resident, Jonathan Crofts has just published a book, **Meadows, Mansions and Munitions: Stories and Lives of Cambridge Park**, bringing together existing and new research, this is the story of the people, architecture and development of Cambridge House and Park in East Twickenham, by Richmond Bridge on the Thames, told in words and pictures.

From rural meadows to the playground of the London wealthy with their grand houses, the original Cambridge Park estate progressed into an affluent riverside suburb with periods including 'Belgium-on-Thames', with its Belgian-staffed WWI munitions factory, later the site of the world-ranking Richmond Ice Rink. Country mansions are still built here today.

Cambridge Park lies on the seventeenth-century Twickenham Meadows, renamed after Richard Owen Cambridge, who was described by Horace Walpole as 'Cambridge the Everything' due to his diverse talents and society connections.

Tales of nobility and merchants, men and women of letters, the arts and entertainment, developers and benefactors, as well as bombs, refugees and shopkeepers, combine to show the evolution of a most distinctive area of modern London.

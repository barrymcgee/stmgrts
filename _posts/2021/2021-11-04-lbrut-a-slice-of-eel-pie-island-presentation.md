Join the Mayor on Friday 12 November at 7pm for A Slice of Eel Pie featuring a show-and-tell extravaganza from Eel Pie Island.

Explore the museum's extensive picture collection on the night which will be accompanied by an 'Eelpiland Club' soundtrack of the '60s, courtesy of DJ Kevin from Eel Pie Records. Tickets for this event will include entry to the museum.

Tickets are &pound;20 per person which includes a cash bar and delicious pie and mash (vegetarian option is also available). All proceeds will go directly to the Mayor's Charities.

This year's Mayor's charities are Habitats & Heritage and A Dose of Nature.â€¯These have been chosen to help raise awareness of the impact of climate change and biodiversity loss within the borough, and also the practical and realistic steps residents and businesses can take to make a positive difference.

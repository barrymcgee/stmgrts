Our small, independent nursery offers more than simply daycare. We prioritise working in close partnerships with parents to best support the development and growth of all our children. We offer flexible arrangements and work with families to ensure each child quickly develops a sense of well-being in our setting and feels confident to explore and learn.

Our experienced, dedicated team are passionate about the early years and organise the environment to stimulate and inspire our little learners, so they thoroughly enjoy all experiences and are well prepared for a life of learning.

We are conveniently located in central St Margarets, opposite the train station. We care for children from 3 months to 5 years, Monday to Friday, between 8am and 6pm. If you would like more information please contact Charlotte on [020 3154 6679](tel:+442031546679) or email [info@thecrownnursery.com](mailto:info@thecrownnursery.com).

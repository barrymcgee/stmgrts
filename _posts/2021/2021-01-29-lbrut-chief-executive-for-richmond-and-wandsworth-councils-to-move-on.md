Chief Executive Paul Martin will be leaving Richmond and Wandsworth councils from March, following his 2019 announcement that he would step down.

Paul Martin joined Wandsworth Council in 2010, and since 2016 has also been Chief Executive of Richmond Council in an innovative Shared Staffing Arrangement. The shared service is a unique staffing model serving half a million Londoners in south west London and focussed on improving public service, innovation and new ways of working.

Mr Martin announced that he would be stepping down from the Autumn of 2020. However, due to the pandemic - delayed his departure to lead the emergency response. He will now be leaving the organisation in March to take up a position as Interim Chief Executive of The Government of Jersey. Proposals will be made to both full councils that Mark Maidment, the Director of Resources and Deputy Chief Executive for the SSA will step-up as interim Chief Executive during the recruitment process.

Cllr Ravi Govindia, Leader of Wandsworth Council, said:

> "Paul Martin has been Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council throughout my entire time as Leader; and he has carried out the role during a period of transformational change in the borough.

> "We have worked closely together to ensure Wandsworth grows and develops for the benefit of the whole community. This includes the immense challenges brought by COVID-19. Paul has led an exceptional group of officers to support our community and enhance Wandsworth's reputation as an exemplar in the way it has risen to these challenges and he leaves a remarkable record of sound achievement.

> "I would like to thank Paul for his eleven years of service here and wish him every success for the future."

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, also paid tribute to Paul Martin's work since joining the SSA.

> "Paul has been a steady hand on the tiller as we navigated our way through the Shared Staffing arrangement with Wandsworth and the perils of the pandemic.  His professionalism and dedication to effective governance has ensured Richmond Council is on a strong footing as we move forward.

> "I would like to thank Paul for everything he has done to lead our tremendous group of staff. Putting his original plans on hold due to the pandemic was just one example of his commitment and devotion to the people of Richmond upon Thames and Wandsworth. On behalf of all the councillors at Richmond - I would like to wish him the best of luck in his new role."

Paul Martin, said:

> "It's been the privilege of my career to be Chief Executive at Wandsworth for the past decade, and also of Richmond since 2016. South West London is widely seen as the most attractive part of the capital city in which to live and work, and this is in no small part due to the work of the two councils.

> "For the past four years, our shared service has delivered &pound;60 million efficiency savings across the two boroughs, meaning we can provide better social care, cleaner streets and more parks and leisure services than would have otherwise been the case. All of this is down to our fantastic staff group which has risen to every challenge asked of them.

> "It's not an easy decision to leave such a fantastic job, but I know in my heart this is the right time for a new Chief Executive to take the two councils into their next phase of growth and development and lead the boroughs through the recovery of the pandemic. My successor will find the spirit of municipal ambition alive and well amongst our members and staff".

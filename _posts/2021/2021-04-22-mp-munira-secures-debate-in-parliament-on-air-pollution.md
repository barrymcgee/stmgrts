Munira Wilson, MP for Twickenham, will next week lead a debate in Parliament, fighting for cleaner air in London. This follows Munira's successful petition calling for the Government to introduce safer air pollution limits, which has attracted the signatures of many local residents.

Air pollution remains a silent killer in the capital, with deadly particles contributing to diabetes, dementia, heart disease and causing problems for children in the womb. Munira's petition called on the Government to take the dangers of air pollution more seriously, by bringing the UK's air pollution targets in line with 2005 World Health Organisation standards.

Munira said:

> "The Conservative Government has continuously failed to tackle air pollution which disproportionately affects the most vulnerable in our society. The fact they haven't dropped plans to expand Heathrow airport shows there is little substance behind their promises to tackle the climate emergency and cut air pollution.

> The success of my petition has shown that introducing safer air pollution limits has proved popular across Twickenham. It's a crucial step forward to improve the health and lives of people locally as well as millions across the UK.

> The people of Twickenham should not have to put up with inadequate Tory policies that are failing to protect their health. This debate I will be leading in Parliament on behalf of local residents is a step forward towards a cleaner, healthier future."

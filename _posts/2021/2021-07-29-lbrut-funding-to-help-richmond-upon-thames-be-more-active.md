Local organisations are invited to apply for funding through the Active  Richmond Fund to boost the borough's offering  of activities that improve people's health and wellbeing.

The Fund is there to support both current and emerging needs for  organisations offering social and physical activities (including sports,  fitness, arts and social groups).

Applications are particularly encouraged from organisations and groups who  work with adults who are less active, in underserved communities, in care  or offer Social Prescribing. Social Prescribing supports people to take  control of their health and wellbeing by connecting them with activities  and support in their local community. In Richmond upon Thames, a major  element of the Social Prescribing Service is delivered by RUILS Charity in  partnership with Richmond GPs, and Richmond Council is working to deliver  more Social Prescribing.

Applicants can either apply for Micro Grants of up to &pound;1,000 or Main Grants  of up to &pound;5,000. A Micro Grant provides short-term and quick funding, for  example if an organisation needed some extra gym equipment. A Main Grant is  for those needing funding for long-term projects, for example if an  organisation wanted to introduce a new activity for a twelve-month period.

&pound;65,000 is available through the fund and so far there have been 22  applications. Examples of funding so far awarded include:

Any project that encourages people to be active and look after their  wellbeing could be awarded funding.

Cllr Piers Allen, Lead member for Adult Social Care and Health and Chair of  the Richmond Health and Wellbeing Board, said:

> "Social Prescribing is being rolled out across the country by the NHS in  partnership with Councils and health and community partners and allows  medical professionals to signpost patients to amazing services in their  community which can help them lead healthier and happier lives.

> "This fund aims to increase our Social Prescribing offering. It's great to  see funding already awarded to some brilliant organisations in Richmond  upon Thames who are improving people's lives, by putting health and  wellbeing at the forefront of everything they do.

> "We are keen to see lots of applications so that we can work towards  becoming an even healthier borough, so do please apply."

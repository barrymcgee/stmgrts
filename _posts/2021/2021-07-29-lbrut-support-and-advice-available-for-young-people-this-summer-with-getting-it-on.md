Getting It On is dedicated to helping teenagers in South West London with  issues such as sexual and mental health, relationship problems, drugs and  alcohol.

Do you know a young person aged 13-19 who might benefit from helpful  information and signposting to services?

The Council's Public Health team are running a campaign to remind young  people in Richmond and Kingston how they can enjoy summer whilst keeping  themselves safe.

It focuses on four main themes:

- Mental wellbeing after lockdown
- Alcohol safety
- Cannabis edibles
- Safer sex

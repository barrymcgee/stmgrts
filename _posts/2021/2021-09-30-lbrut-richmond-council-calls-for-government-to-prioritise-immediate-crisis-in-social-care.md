Richmond Council has voiced concerns that the government's recent  announcement on social care funding reforms is not enough to tackle the  immediate crisis facing the sector and the thousands of local residents who  rely on state support.

Speaking at the Full Council meeting last night (Tuesday 28 September),  Councillor Robin Brown, Lead Member for Finance and Resources, said that  the implementation of the reforms will cost upfront money and the  government has not made it clear whether local tax-payers will once again  be asked to cover the gap.

More urgently, Richmond upon Thames, along with local authorities and care  providers across the country, face a crisis in care provision now, with  high turnover and vacancy rates impacting the care residents are receiving.

Cllr Brown said:

> "There is still much the government needs to make clear about the new  funding arrangements which apply from 2023 but there are immediate issues  to deal with now.

> "We are concerned about cost pressures for the Council due to the increase  in national insurance. Whilst we expect our own direct payroll costs to be  covered, our contractors and suppliers will be facing a cost squeeze and  may look to pass some of that on. Our local schools will likely be in the  same boat.

> "Many care homes are already under huge financial pressure, from COVID-19  grant support ending, energy price hikes and now national insurance cost  increases. There are even reports that some banks are unwilling to lend to  the sector.

> "Longer term, more Richmond residents will ultimately receive state-funded  care as a result of the changes, but Councils will have to pay for this,  along with proposed extra staff training and possibly higher care home  fees. This will increase the bill for the Council and it is currently  unclear how and when we will be provided with funding. We hope that local  taxpayers will not once again be expected to contribute."

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing  Services Committee, added:

> "There is a crisis right now, in the recruitment and retention of social  care staff, not just in this borough, but across London and across the  country.

> "Richmond Council and its contractors pay staff the London Living Wage, but  in general lower pay rates, a difficulty of recruiting from overseas and  challenges in retaining younger workers are all contributing to the  problem. Combined with the requirement that all care home staff are  vaccinated, the chronic staff shortage is creating extra stress in the  system.

> "This is an issue that care providers and councils have been flagging to  government for a very long time - it is disappointing and concerning that  this urgent issue has not been addressed in the government's plans."

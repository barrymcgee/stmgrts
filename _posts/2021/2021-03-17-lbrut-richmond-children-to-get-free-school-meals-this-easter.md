Children from the borough's lowest-income families will continue to receive school meal vouchers this Easter holiday.

Since the October half term, Richmond Council has continued to fund school holiday food support packages for vulnerable children, meaning that children from the borough's lowest-income families don't go hungry over the school break. So far, 3,452 children have received vouchers in school holidays, and this support will continue throughout the Easter holidays, using funding from the local Winter Grand fund.

Families who require additional assistance can also apply for funding from one of our local partners:

- [Richmond Aid](http://www.richmondaid.org.uk/contact-us/) - 020 8831 6070
- [Citizens Advice Richmond](https://www.citizensadvicerichmond.org/) -  080 82 78 78 73

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> "We want to make sure that no child goes without during the school holidays. We know that many families continue to struggle, being hit hard by the pandemic. Some are worried about how they will put food on the table.

> "These vouchers will offer some reassurance. And for those who need further support, they can apply for additional funding or help from one of our local partner organisations through our [Coronavirus Winter Support Fund](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/health_protection_information/coronavirus_information/where_can_i_find_help_or_support/covid-19_support_for_residents/what_help_is_available/winter_support_grant)."

Join Beth for a dynamic blend of Yoga and Pilates to breathe better, stand taller and move with greater freedom and ease.  Yogalates is ideal if you're craving the stretch and relaxation benefits of Yoga but would also benefit from the core strengthening, postural work that Pilates offers.  It's popular with a wide range of ages and abilities, both men and women, and is suitable for beginners to experienced students.

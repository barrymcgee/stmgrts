Another thing to do during the lockdown and 'wow' your family at the same time.

> "The Pyramid is smooth and its every angle is designed precisely so that the Sun's rays help the soul of the mighty King ascend to heaven peacefully and join him with the Gods."

The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Khufu over a 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Ever since its construction, this massive stone structure has been surrounded by myth and magic. The author Erich von Daniken argues that the pyramid was built by extra-terrestrials using technology unknown to us earthlings and the accuracy of its construction were to line it up with stars in Orion's belt and so ease the journey of the soul of the pharaoh to the heavenly paradise in the fields of Aaru. Von Daniken also suggests that the Pyramid was a sort of freezing chamber, in which the dead could be preserved until such time as the sun god Ra returns to revive them.

In the 1930s, a French pendulum-dowsing author, Antoine Bovis, developed the idea that small models of pyramids could preserve food. Apparently while standing inside the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, Bovis saw a garbage can inside the chamber piled with dead animals that had wandered into the structure.  He noticed that these small carcasses were not decaying and inferred that the structure had somehow preserved them.

In 1949, inspired by Bovis, a Czechoslovakian named Karel Drbal applied for a patent on a *"Pharaoh's shaving device"*, a model pyramid alleged to maintain the sharpness of razor blades. According to the patent *"The method of maintaining the razor blades and straight razor blades sharp by placing them in the magnetic field in such a way that the sharp edge lies in the direction of the magnetic lines."* Drbal alleged that his device would focus *"the earth's magnetic field"*, although he did not make it clear how this would work, or whether the device's shape or materials exerted the effect. The scientist and author Patrick Flanagan picked up the idea by arguing that pyramids with the exact relative dimensions of Egyptian pyramids act as *"an effective resonator of randomly polarized microwave signals which can be converted into electrical energy,"* and could therefore preserve materials placed within.

Now you can test the theory for yourself, but first, you have to make a cardboard pyramid with the exact relative dimensions of the Great Pyramid of Giza. No slaves are required for this task.

1. Take a piece of fairly stiff cardboard and cut a precise square from it. Each side needs to be about 20cm long.
1. Accurately divide the square into 4 identical quarters, top to bottom and then left to right. See the attached drawing.
1. Draw a diagonal line across the bottom right-hand quarter, from the middle of the bottom of the original square (point A) to the middle of the side of the original square (point B).
1. Accurately measure the length of this diagonal line A to B.
1. Repeat this measure up the central dividing line on the original square and mark point C.
1. Finally draw lines from point C to the bottom corners of your original square, D and E.
1. You now have a triangle with three points, C, D and E.
1. Cut the triangle out and use it as a template cut out three more identical triangles.
1. Carefully stick the 4 triangles together to form a pyramid with proportionate height and sides leaning in at precisely 51 degrees, 51 minutes, 14 seconds... just like Khafu's

#### HOW TO RUN YOUR EXPERIMENT

<a href="/assets/images/2021/PYRAMID_cardboard-pyramid.jpg" title="Click for a larger image"><img src="/assets/images/2021/PYRAMID_cardboard-pyramid-thumb.jpg" width="250" alt="Image - PYRAMID_cardboard-pyramid"  class="photo right"/></a>


1. Put the pyramid on a flat surface, in a place where it doesn't have to be moved for a week or two.
1. Using a compass line up the base of the pyramid north to south one way, east to west the other. (Dedicated pyramidologists will tell you to line it up towards true north, rather than magnetic north.)
1. Place your test specimen underneath the centre of the pyramid. Soft fruit or vegetables are recommended like tomatoes, strawberries, grapes, avocados or small lettuces.
1. As a *"control"* place another test specimen of the same type in the same place but not too close to the pyramid.
1. NEXT? Apart from checking the two test specimens, the *"control"* and the one under the pyramid, every couple of days - Do nothing!

If Pyramid Power works for you the specimen under the pyramid will remain reasonably fresh while the *"control"* specimen will rot. I cannot guarantee either of these statements as the last time I tried the experiment our cat knocked over the pyramid and the tomato underneath splattered all over the kitchen floor. I will repeat the experiment if I need to *"ketchup"*!

Pyramidologists claim that Pyramid Power will also sharpen razors, function *"as a thought-form incubator"*, trigger sexual urges, and improve meditation and general health. To achieve some of those effects it is thought necessary to actually sleep underneath a Khufu pyramid if you can find a large enough piece of cardboard to build one.

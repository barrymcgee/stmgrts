Richmond is a low crime borough; indeed against most measures we're one of  the safest, if not the safest London borough in which to live. And perhaps  that's one of the reasons why, when we come up against issues such as  antisocial behaviour, we tend to notice it more.

Of course, the fact that we live in a low crime borough in no way suggests  that we should seek to downplay the impact of antisocial behaviour. It's  fair to say that the vast majority of borough residents will never fall  victim to any form of crime, however for many people it is the fear of  crime which is a pervasive and pernicious force, and acts of antisocial  behaviour tend to feed that fear.

And that's why this administration has always placed a high degree of  importance on tackling the issue of antisocial behaviour in our borough,  whether it was investing in additional patrols to tackle the problems seen  on Richmond and Twickenham Greens last summer, funding similar patrols  around Teddington Lock, investing in temporary toilet provision in the  borough and tackling the seemingly never-ending tide of graffiti.

And this week we're supporting the first ever Antisocial Behaviour  Awareness Week. We're working with partner agencies, including the  Metropolitan Police, to ensure residents know how they can report  antisocial behaviour and how they can ask the council and those agencies to  intervene if they find such behaviours to be either frightening or a  nuisance

No one's quality of life should be badly affected by other people's  behaviour. While not all antisocial behaviour is classed as a crime, a lot  is and incidents that might start small can build up and become very  serious. Reporting antisocial behaviour means you won't have to deal with  it on your own and is a vital step in helping reduce antisocial behaviour  across Richmond upon Thames.

Make the most of our Great British Summer with a glorious carriage ride in Bushy Park on weekends during August. The Royal Parks Shires will be put to a stunning Charabanc, evoking memories of times gone by.  Rides last approx. 30 minutes, and start and finish on Chestnut Avenue, between the Pheasantry and the main car park.

It's for a good cause, too.  Proceeds from the rides will enable the Shire horses to undertake conservation work in winter, making Bushy Park even greener.  Shire horses are rarer than pandas - join them for a ride this Summer.

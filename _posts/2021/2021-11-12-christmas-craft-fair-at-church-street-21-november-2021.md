Church Street will be celebrating the start of the Christmas season with the Christmas Craft Fair on Sunday 21 November to be in unison with Twickenham's Light Switch On.

There will a great variety of craft stalls from local artists, local charities, street food and festive drinks. The innovative Church Street Traders will also be getting into the Christmas Spirit with tempting gifts, offers and displays!

There will be plenty of Christmas entertainment for everyone with live music from local bands in the square from 1.30 to 2.30pm (St Margarets Elastic Band) and the Richmond Music Trust from 3.30 to 5.30pm, face painting, balloon modelling and more! Come early for the special Victorian Punch and Judy at 12, 1 and 2.30pm!

The fair, which is being organised by the Church Street Association, will run from 12 to 6pm with free entry for all attendees.

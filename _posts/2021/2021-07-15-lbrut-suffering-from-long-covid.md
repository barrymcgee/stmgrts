Many people recovering from COVID-19 are still coming to terms with the  impact the virus has had on both their body and mind and are still trying  to shake off the effects of the virus.

The symptoms are wide-ranging and fluctuating, and can include  breathlessness, chronic fatigue, 'brain fog', anxiety and stress. The NHS  in South West London has created the [Long COVID recovery page](https://www.swlondon.nhs.uk/ourwork/long-covid-recovery/) to share self-help resources and links to local service that are available  to people who are experiencing long COVID (which you may also hear referred  to as post COVID).

You can [share your experiences of long COVID](https://www.healthwatchrichmond.co.uk/news/2021-06-21/long-covid-tell-us-your-experiences) with Healthwatch, to help improve the support and services that are  available.

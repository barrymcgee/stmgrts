  As 2021 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that's gone by, as we have in previous years.  This year is notably different, like 2021, as Covid stopped a lot of events.

As 2021 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that has gone by, as we have in [2020](/archives/2021/01/st_margarets_community_website_2020_review.html), [2019](/archives/2021/01/st_margarets_community_website_2019_review.html), [2018](/archives/2019/01/st_margarets_community_website_2018_review.html), [2017](/archives/2017/12/st_margarets_community_website_2017_review.html), [2016](/archives/2016/12/st_margarets_community_website_2016_review.html), [2015](/archives/2015/12/st_margarets_community_website_2015_review.html) and [2014](/archives/2014/12/st_margarets_community_website_2014_review.html). Like last year, this year is notably different as Covid stopped a lot of events from happening.

### Articles and events

This year we wrote more articles, but Covid caused a big drop in events.

#### Twitter

We have not been the best twitter user again this year, but all events and articles are posted there.

| Social    | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  | 2018  | 2017  | 2016  |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| followers | 3,612 | 3,647 | 3,576 | 3,470 | 3,410 | 3,192 |
| tweets    | 321   | 394   | 1,145 | 1,162 | 917   | 1,644 |

#### Usage stats

These are down a bit from last year, perhaps because there were fewer of Martyn Day's articles:

| Usage stats       | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016    |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Sessions          | 92,489  | 101,038 | 119,875 | 110,629 | 63,915  | 63,903  |
| Users             | 75,909  | 84,467  | 99,007  | 88,377  | 48,410  | 47,013  |
| Pageviews         | 124,194 | 134,901 | 162,576 | 156,603 | 103,235 | 110,505 |
| Pages per session | 1.34    | 1.34    | 1.36    | 1.42    | 1.62    | 1.73    |

### How people accessed the site

<a href="/assets/images/2021/chart-2021-tech.png" title="Click for a larger image"><img src="/assets/images/2021/chart-2021-tech.png" width="250" alt="Image - chart-2021-tech"  class="photo right"/></a>

One trend we have been watching is how many people are now using the site on phones and tablets. This is why we continue making the site work better on smaller screens. This year's mobile usage is still over half of all sessions, however, Desktop users grew as more people were at home because of Covid.

| Device  | 2021   | Change&nbsp;from&nbspfrom2020 |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Desktop | 41.42% | 4.25%                         |
| Mobile  | 53.43% | -2.4%                         |
| Tablet  | 5.15%  | -1.85%                        |

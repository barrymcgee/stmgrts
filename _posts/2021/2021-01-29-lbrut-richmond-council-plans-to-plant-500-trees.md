The Council is on track to plant over 500 trees across Richmond upon Thames by the end of the tree planting season (31 March 2021).

This is the highest number of trees to be planted in a single planting season for over 10 years. Since the start of November, 253 trees have been planted in line with Richmond's Climate Emergency Strategy commitment to increase tree cover in the borough.

The Council would like to thank the local groups and organisations who have so far helped to plant trees in the following sites:

- Heathfield Recreation Ground, Heathfield - 16 news trees including types of elm and lime
- Carlisle Park, Hampton - 11 new trees to form a sensory trail as part of the Friendly Parks for All initiative
- School House Lane, Teddington - new fruit trees added to the community orchard
- Twickenham Green, Twickenham - new Horse Chesnuts
- Moormead Recreation Ground, St Margarets and North Twickenham - 9 new trees including hawthorn and cherry

Trees are currently being planted or scheduled to be planted soon will be in the following sites:

- Cambridge Gardens, Twickenham
- Chase Green, Whitton
- Ham Common, Ham
- North Sheen Recreation Ground, Kew

The Council was also successful in its bid for funding from the Government initiative The Urban Tree Challenge Fund. This will see 123 trees planted in areas where canopy cover is less than 20% in Heathfield, Whitton, Barnes and Hampton.

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sports Services Committee, said:

> "This is excellent news! Trees are essential for people, wildlife and the environment, and they're a hugely important part of our plans to address the climate emergency. Trees are a powerful ally; they can help by reducing carbon dioxide levels and flood risk, moderating extremes of temperature, and improving air quality. They also provide habitat for many species, supporting biodiversity in the borough.

> "I am thrilled to see so many trees being planted in this planting season, and I thank everyone involved."

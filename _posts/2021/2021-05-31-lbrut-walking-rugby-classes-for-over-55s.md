Are you over 55 and looking for a fun activity to keep you active? Why not try Richmond Rugby's free walking rugby?

Walking rugby classes take place every Tuesday morning from 10 to 11.30 am at Richmond Athletic Ground.

The sessions are open to everyone and there is also free refreshments served afterwards so you can have a chat and meet new people.

For more information and to register your place contact Head of Community  Dom Palacio on  [communitydept@richmondfc.co.uk](mailto:communitydept@richmondfc.co.uk).

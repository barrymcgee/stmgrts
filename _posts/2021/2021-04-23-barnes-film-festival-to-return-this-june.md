Barnes' annual film festival will return this summer from Thursday 17 to  Wednesday 23 June 2021.

The [Barnes Film Festival](https://www.barnesfilmfestival.com/) is returning for its sixth year this June to showcase the best film making talents from up-and-coming storytellers.

The festival organisers held a special preview virtual Q&A on Thursday 22 April with special guests Tom Holland and Edgar Wright. The weeklong programme of events will include workshops, discussions, screenings and gatherings which will be held online to accommodate larger audiences during the pandemic.

Yes, we are back! Our last Christmas concert was two years ago in the heady days before Covid.

The choir has kept going throughout this time and we are delighted to welcome you to join us in a concert of seasonal music at the lovely [All Hallows Church](https://stmargarets.london/directory/church/200506080815) on the A316 this coming Saturday - 11 December at 7 pm. Doors open at 6.40 pm. There will be a bar and mince pies and some audience carols. And &pound;5 for a ticket, with children going free.

Just one point of course. We are mindful of continued risks from Covid, so the church has social distancing built into its seating arrangements and we will have to place a limit on tickets. Having said that, we don't expect to run out of places.

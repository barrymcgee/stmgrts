Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "The beautiful new design from Hopkins presents a great opportunity for Twickenham and the wider borough. We've listened and engaged more than ever before and I'm confident that when residents see the plans that they will be as enthused as I am about what promises to be an exciting new chapter in Twickenham's history; one which will see Twickenham Riverside opened up and become as much of a destination as the incredibly popular Richmond Riverside.

The hard work of residents in working with us to deliver a truly exceptional vision for Twickenham, and to provide a beautiful riverside which will be enjoyed for generations, has really paid off and I look forward to hearing their views. Together we will deliver what the borough has been waiting decades for, a new heart for Twickenham."

Over the past twelve months, Hopkins Architects and their team, with help from the Council, have been working hard to develop the design for the Twickenham Riverside site. This follows a public design competition held in 2019.

The development of the proposal includes responding to feedback received during the competition, working through detail with key stakeholders such as Eel Pie Island and the Twickenham Riverside Trust, but also important flood modelling work with organisations such as the Environment Agency - to make sure that the scheme meets the flooding requirements and will continue to do so in a world impacted by climate change.

The scheme will deliver housing (including affordable homes), office space, shops, a caf&#233; and pub/restaurant and plenty of open space. This open space includes relocating the Diamond Jubilee Gardens into a larger space in the centre of the proposed development, with suggestions for event space, an exciting children's play area and p&#233;tanque pitches as well as terraced lawns, more planting and additional trees.  The proposal also includes public open space along the Embankment with a flexible events space and a widened Water Lane with inviting views from King Street.

As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, Richmond residents are being urged to  continue doing everything they can to stop the virus spreading after  national restrictions come to an end on Monday, 19 July 2021.

Over the past seven days there have been over 570 confirmed cases of  COVID-19 in Richmond upon Thames, and the borough has a case rate of 289  per 100,000.

Residents are therefore asked to continue to wear face coverings in indoor  public spaces, even if not legally required to do so, as well as to get  tested, keep their space from others they do not know, stay in well  ventilated areas and to get vaccinated.

Richmond Council is also continuing to ask visitors to all its buildings  e.g. libraries, sports centres, and the Civic Centre, to continue to wear  face coverings, to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer before entering  and maintain a safe distance. Council staff will also continue to observe  COVID-19 safe measures when you meet them. [See information regarding Council services](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/health_protection_information/coronavirus_information/how_we_are_protecting_you/how_services_are_affected).

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "The Government has been clear that the dangers from coronavirus are far  from over, even today Professor Whitty has said we are not out of the woods  and hospitalisations could reach scary numbers quite quickly. Therefore, we  need to be cautious and take responsibility for our actions after the  national restrictions are lifted.

> "This is critical as cases continue to increase in Richmond and more people  in our community become infected. The Council will be maintaining its  current COVID-19-secure measures after 19 July to keep all residents and  our staff safe. I know many other employers and venues are also likely to  continue to exercise caution in line with the Government guidance and ask  people to wear face coverings in busy indoor spaces. I hope everyone will  support them and play their part to keep Richmond safe."

Shannon Katiyo, Director of Public Health for Richmond upon Thames, added:

> "COVID-19 will continue to pose a significant risk after the mandatory  restrictions are lifted. We cannot afford to ease up now on our combined  efforts to fight the virus.

> "We are seeing an increase in the percentage of tests returning a positive  result in Richmond. We know there will be people who have COVID-19 and  passing it on, but don't know it. Please take a [lateral flow test](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/health_protection_information/coronavirus_information/covid_19_testing) to check that this isn't you. Do it routinely twice a week, especially  before you meet with other people.

> "Make sure to get both doses of the [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/news/july_2021/residents_urged_to_keep_up_covid_safety_measures#). There are plenty of appointments and walk-ins available across the  borough. If you are vaccinated you are more unlikelyâ€¯to get seriously ill,  be admitted to hospital, or to die."

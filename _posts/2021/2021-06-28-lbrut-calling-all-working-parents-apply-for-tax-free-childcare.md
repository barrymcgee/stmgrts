Working parents in Richmond upon Thames are reminded that they can use  Tax-Free Childcare to help pay for their childcare costs over the summer.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) provides Tax-Free Childcare for children aged  up to 11, or 17 if the child has a disability. This can be used to help pay  for accredited holiday clubs, childminders or sport activities.

Working parents can open an online account at any time and the government  will pay &pound;2 for every &pound;8 that gets paid towards a childcare provider via  the online account. This is capped at &pound;500 every 3 months, or &pound;1,000 if the  child is disabled. Parents and carers can [check their eligibility and register for Tax-Free Childcare via GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare).

30,665 working families used their account in March 2021 in London. And in  the same month, HMRC paid out more than &pound;33 million in top-up payments,  which was shared between more than 282,000 families across the UK.

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee  for Richmond upon Thames, said:

> "The pandemic and its lockdowns have been extremely challenging for parents  and carers managing childcare at home. The government's top-up Tax-Free  Childcare scheme will hopefully take some pressure off parents and carers,  as well as giving children more opportunity to have fun over the school  summer holidays. I encourage all working parents and carers to set up their  online accounts to help with childcare costs."

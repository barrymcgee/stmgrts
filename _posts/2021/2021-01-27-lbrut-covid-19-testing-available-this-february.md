People who are displaying symptoms of COVID-19 are reminded that they can also get tested at the temporary pop-up testing centre in Old Deer Park, on selected dates this February.

In addition to the drive-in testing centre at Twickenham Stadium and walk-in centre in Teddington, the tests are being offered to anyone WITH Coronavirus symptoms. See below for the dates. More information on being tested and how to book your [SYMPTOMATIC test](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested).

Those residents in the borough NOT displaying COVID-19 symptoms, who are either essential workers, volunteering, providing vital support for a vulnerable resident, or need regular reassurance that they don't have COVID-19, can also now apply for a rapid COVID-19 test. More information on being tested for an [ASYMPTOMATIC test](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/wellbeing_and_lifestyle/health_protection_information/coronavirus_information/book_lateral_flow_test).

The main symptoms of the disease are:

- A high temperature - this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
- A new, continuous cough - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
- Loss or change to your sense of smell or taste - this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal

**Please note, if Richmond is not shown as one of the options when you book, please try again later.**

Leader of Richmond Council, Cllr Gareth Roberts, said:

> "Whilst we are still in a national lockdown and it is essential that we all stay home, it is equally important that we all take action if we start to display symptoms. This means people must isolate straight away, followed by applying for a COVID-19 test.

> "There is now a huge capacity in Richmond to get tested. So - if you are showing any of the symptoms, self-isolate to ensure you don't put anyone at risk AND get a test straight away.

> "Whilst most people are following the Government guidance and staying at home, there are some who cannot, for work, volunteering or caring responsibilities. If this is you - get a regular lateral flow test, and make an appointment to come twice a week."

The pop-up testing centre is available at Old Deer Park throughout FEBRUARY ONLY to those people with an appointment:

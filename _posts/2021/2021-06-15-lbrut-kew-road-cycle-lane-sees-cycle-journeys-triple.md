Richmond upon Thames' first protected cycle lane (Kew Road) continues to  see more and more users. In the last six months the route has seen an  increase in usage of 82% based on the weekly average of cycle users.

Data collected from cameras on the road have recorded an average of 1,950  journeys per week being made by cyclists along the segregated cycle lane.  In November 2020, this figure had increased to 1,070. The latest figures  show use is over three times that recorded in 2018 (556 cyclists), before  any scheme was put into place.

The cycle lane was introduced in 2020 as part of the borough's Post-COVID  Action Travel Plan, to enable safe cycling along Kew Road and to allow  residents to move around the area easily while maintaining social  distancing.

With funding secured from Transport for London (TfL), Richmond Council  implemented a system of raised posts (known as wands and armadillos) to  protect the cycle lanes from the traffic lanes between Lion Gate Gardens  and Kew Gardens Road. The Council also introduced a mandatory 24-hour cycle  lane in both directions, upgraded the yellow line waiting restrictions to  double yellow lines and introduced peak hour loading restrictions (7am to  7pm).

Councillor Alexander Ehmann, Chairman of the Transport and Air Quality  Committee, said:

> "These figures are truly extraordinary and we haven't even hit the summer  season where we expect the number of users to grow further still. A  tripling of users is a stellar achievement and I'm glad that so many  residents and visitors are making use of this great facility.

> "Until we introduced this protected cycle lane, Kew Road was essentially  operating as a free parking-lot for cars and coaches. As a result of this,  the Northbound cycle lane was dangerous and inaccessible for cyclists  during most of the day.

> "The Council will be determining the future of the Kew Road arrangements at  a January meeting of the Transport and Air Quality Committee. Today's  figures show that there can be no doubt on usage - that this scheme is a  runaway winner.

> "These figures underline the importance of TfL working constructively with  Richmond Council to make much needed changes to cycling provision over Kew  Bridge, where TfL's recent alterations have arguably made it the weakest  part of this corridor."

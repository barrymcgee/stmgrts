The Skiff Club was founded 126 years ago prompted by the popularity of waterborne activity for leisure at the time and the development of Skiff  Racing at local regattas.

Thames skiffs are the direct descendants of working boats on the Thames,  used as water-borne 'taxis'. They developed on the non-tidal Thames in to leisure craft used for picnicking, touring and for racing.

With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions has allowed everyone to enjoy the outdoor sport together, why not learn new skills and enjoy good exercise in a social manner.

The Skiff Club is inviting residents to enjoy learning to row in their traditional boats at their club in Trowlock Way, Teddington.

Skiffing is a form of rowing in stable boats, easy to learn basic skills,  leading to good exercise and opportunities to race in local events on the  Thames under the Skiff Racing Association.

Regular club activities include rowing on Saturday and Sunday mornings (the latter often including a pub stop) and on spring and summer evenings.

Their friendly bar is open on Thursday evenings for well-earned refreshments. and they also organize occasional expeditions to other inland waters. Contact  [captain@theskiffclub.org.uk](mailto:captain@theskiffclub.org.uk) to arrange a free taster session.

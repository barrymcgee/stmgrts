Over fifty inspiring individuals, groups and businesses have been recognised across ten categories, as Richmond Council announces its 2020 Community Heroes' Awards.

Richmond Council received over 200 nominations for this year's awards which celebrates those willing to go above and beyond to make their communities better places in which to live and work. This year's awards also took on the additional role of recognising the huge local response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nominations ranged from environmental projects to sporting activities, community initiatives and charity trustees. Due to the sheer volume of nominations received this year, for the following categories no shortlist could be selected by our judges: Outstanding Volunteer, Helping Hands, Young Person Achievement. All nominees for these categories will be sent a certificate of commendation.

All those shortlisted have been sent a certificate, as well as our winners who have been written to by Cllr Michael Wilson. There will be no celebration event currently due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The winners are:

- Business Contribution in the Community - **The Angel & Crown**
- Community Group of the Year - **Richmond upon Thames Neighbourhood Care Groups**
- Community Project of the Year - **SPADE gardening project**
- Environmental Award - **Ian George Andrews**
- Helping Hands - **Ginny Spittle**
- Outstanding Sporting Achievement - **Richmond Parkrun**
- Young Person Achievement - **George Muderack**
- Trustee of the Year - **Robert Bollen**
- Outstanding Volunteer
*No winner could be selected for this category, all have been sent certificates of commendation.*

The Lifetime Achievement award has been given posthumously to **Howard Greenwood**. Howard was Chairman and Music director of the Richmond Concert Society for over 57 years and worked with the Arts Council Schools music trust as well as in a community partnership with the RFU. He was a frequent judge at the May Day fairs on Richmond and Twickenham Green, and has encouraged many young children in the borough to take up musical instruments. Sadly Howard has recently passed away and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Cabinet Member for Equality, Communities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "It should be a badge of pride and honour for this borough that each year we see such a staggering breadth of work done by our residents, expecting nothing in return, to make their communities a better place to in which to live.

> "Whether you give of your time as an individual or a group, the time commitment and motivation is significant. This is a chance for us to show our gratitude to you for all that you do, especially during this year which has provided many challenges for us all.

> "I hope to welcome our shortlisted nominees to a celebration event in person when we are able, but for now I want to warmly congratulate and thank you all for everything you have done and continue to do for our borough".

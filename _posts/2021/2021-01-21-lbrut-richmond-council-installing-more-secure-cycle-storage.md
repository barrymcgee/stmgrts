Secure Bikehangars are being installed in six streets with more streets to follow.

The locations were selected following requests and consultation with residents. Bikehangars are designed to provide secure on-street cycle parking. Each hangar can safely and securely store up to six bikes and are only accessed by people who have signed up to the scheme and paid for a space.

The Council already plans to deploy a further cohort of 15 Bikehangars in 2021. Sites for these additional Bikehangars are currently being selected and consultation will follow in March 2021 with installations taking place later this year. Given the increasing demand for these facilities, the Council expects installations to become a rolling process.

Residents can apply for a space in a Bikehangar on their street or on their neighbouring street by going to the Cyclehoop website.

The streets where Bikehangars are being installed are:

- Cambridge Road, Teddington
- Edwin Road, South Twickenham
- Fulwell Road, Fulwell and Hampton Hill
- Hartington Road, St Margarets and North Twickenham
- St Margarets Road, Twickenham Riverside
- Walpole Road, Teddington

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee for Richmond Council, said:

> "Bikehangars offer a solution to people who would otherwise be unable to securely store a bike, for example those without gardens or enough room inside their homes.

> "Improving and increasing cycling in the borough is a key commitment within our wider aim of tackling air quality, climate change and congestion. Ensuring plenty of cycle parking is essential to this and I encourage people to register their interest in having one in their street, so we can roll the scheme out in as many parts of the borough as possible."

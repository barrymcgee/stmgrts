An exhibition of new images by Himali Singh Soin with historian of science Alexis Rider will open at Orleans House Gallery on Friday, 19 November, inspired by the collection of Sir Richard Burton.

Sir Richard Burton's search for the source of the Nile is considered the epitome of nineteenth century Imperial exploration. However, the expedition is steeped in colonial notions of place and otherness. It is also the story of an environment that steadfastly resists being known. Alexis and Himali will interrogate Burton's search for the Nile. They will bring the river and its landscape, both real and imagined, to the foreground.

The exhibition presents a series of photographs that contain ghosts and shadows of the Burton collection. The images can be viewed alongside an accompanying text drawn from many sources, which offers an interpretive starting point for the images. Visitors are invited to explore archives, contested histories, and the nature of human and more-than-human relationships.

The exhibition will run from 19 November 2021 until 13 March 2022.

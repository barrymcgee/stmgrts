Preparations are in full swing to open our doors to the public again!

It has been more than a year and a half since the last Open Studio in December 2019, so we hope you are looking forward to see our new work as much as we are to show it to you!

If you are interested in art and craft, there is lots to discover right at your doorstep - please come along to see, chat with the artists and enjoy a home made snack...

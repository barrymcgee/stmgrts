Residents are being encouraged to apply for their postal vote for this year's re-scheduled elections as soon as possible, to ensure that their applications are processed in time.

On Thursday 6 May 2021, London will go to the polls, with residents having their say on who represents them as Mayor of London and at the London Assembly elections. Plans are well underway to help everyone stay safe while they are casting their vote.

There are a number of ways to have your say in the elections in May - you can vote in a polling station, by post, or by appointing someone you trust to vote on your behalf, which is known as a proxy vote.

Whilst officers are working hard to ensure that polling stations will be COVID-safe, we are aware that many people will prefer to have their say in the elections, from the comfort of their own home. Therefore, the advice from the Council is get your postal vote application in now!

Residents who are not already on the electoral register must register by midnight on Monday 19 April. Please note that if you receive and pay Council Tax bills you are not automatically included on the register.

Mike Gravatt, Borough Returning Officer for the GLA election, said:

> "The elections this year are very important. They are an opportunity for our residents to have their say on who represents them on issues that directly affect all our lives.

> "We have been planning for these elections for some time to make sure that however people choose to vote, they can do so safely. We're putting arrangements in place to help everyone stay safe at polling stations. People can expect many of the measures they've become used to in shops and banks over recent months, such as hand sanitiser, floor markings and face masks. There will also be a queuing system and of course social distancing.

> "However, of course people can register to vote by post. We are expecting a lot of people to register for the first time. Therefore, please do not wait until the last minute. Apply now."

Residents who are on the electoral register and would like a postal vote, or wish to make changes to their existing postal 5pm on Tuesday 20 April.

If you are already permanently registered for a postal vote you will not need to apply again. British citizens, along with citizens of qualifying Commonwealth countries and British Overseas Territories are all eligible to vote in this election.  British citizens who live overseas and are registered as overseas electors will not be able to vote in these elections.

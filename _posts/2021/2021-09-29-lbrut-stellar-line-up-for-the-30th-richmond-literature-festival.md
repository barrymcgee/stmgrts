Richmond Literature Festival has launched its 2021 programme of events for  the 30<sup>th</sup> edition of the much-loved literature festival. This year's festival takes  place from 5 - 21 November and will see a return to in person events  following last year's move online due to the pandemic.

The programme includes talks by authors, historians, politicians and more,  with writing workshops, as well as activities for children and families.  This year's festival will explore the theme of 'breaking ground.' Through  literature and ideas, we imagine the new possibilities of our future. The  past eighteen months have seen massive upheaval and innovation across the  globe. On our ever-changing planet, how can we work towards a world that's  more sustainable, more inclusive and more equal? What exactly is the 'new  normal' and what does it mean for us?

The festival will begin on Friday 5 November with a panel discussion  entitled 'This is How We Come Back Stronger' with guests including  international bestselling author of The Burning Chambers Series Kate Mosse, writer and film maker Juliet Jacques, and Sara Collins, author of The Confessions of Frannie Langton.

Other programme highlights include:

- Environmentalist and former director of Friends of the Earth Jonathon Porritt CBE joins a panel of speakers, including Dr Alice Bell, to explore how we can take collective action to avert runaway climate change in the light of COP26.
- Monique Roffey, winner of the 2020 Costa Book Of The Year for The Mermaid of Black Conch, joins Courttia Newland in conversation to discuss their approaches to exploring contemporary issues through literary fiction.
- Award winning journalist and broadcaster Sathnam Sanghera discusses his book Empireland and how understanding the history of imperialism is fundamental to understanding Britain today with Professor Corinne Fowler, author of the National Trusts report on it's historic houses links to empire.
- Natasha Brown and Caleb Azumah Nelson, writers of two of 2021's most highly anticipated debuts come together in conversation.
- 'Sarvat Hasin, Natalie Hanes, and Charlotte Higgins discuss their approaches to reinterpreting and retelling the stories of the women of Greek myth.
- Nadifa Mohamed, author of the Fortune Men which was recently shortlisted for the Booker Prize

Cllr John Coombs, Spokesperson for Arts, said:

> "I am delighted that Richmond Literature Festival is returning  for its special 30<sup>th</sup> edition. This year's programme of events promises to be extra special  given the return to live events following last year's move to online  events and the difficult past year for our local arts and culture sector.

> "The last year has shown us just how important our arts are to all  of us, and Richmond Literature Festival is one of the best literature  festivals in the country. This year's programme includes something for all  interests. The theme of Breaking Ground has brought an exciting group of  writers and thinkers together at the festival, which will be a unique  opportunity see some acclaimed writers exploring some of the most important  issues of our times. It's a busy mixture of events, talks and panel  discussions, a great workout for the mind, so get out and support  your local arts this November. I look forward to seeing you there."

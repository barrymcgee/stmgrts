Following the Easter Bank Holidays on Friday 2 April and Monday 5 April, Richmond Council will carry out general rubbish, food waste, garden waste and recycling collections for domestic properties one day later than usual, for one week.

For example, Friday collections will take place on Saturday, and Monday collections on the Tuesday.

- There will be no change for those receiving commercial waste and recycling collection services.
- There will be no collections for bulky waste available on Friday 2 April or Monday 5 April.

Normal domestic collection schedules for general rubbish, food waste and recycling will resume a week later on Monday 12 April.

Residents are asked to ensure their recycling and refuse is available for collection by 6.00am on collection day at the boundary of their property beside the entrance, i.e. where their front garden or drive meets the pavement.

To reduce issues with street litter and trip hazards, only households without front gardens, drives or equivalent are permitted to present recycling and refuse on the pavement and should only do this after 8pm on the day before collection.

The Council is also encouraging residents to be mindful of excessive packaging from Easter egg boxes and to dispose of packaging correctly via household recycling collections.

Similarly, residents are being asked to avoid doing any major clear-outs during this time and are reminded that charity shops are currently closed. Leaving unwanted items outside charity shops will be classified as a fly-tip and residents may be fined for doing so.

Residents are reminded that Townmead Road Household Waste and Recycling Centre will be open over the Bank Holiday, but pre-booking is essential. [Residents can book a slot to bring household waste to Townmead Road for free](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/waste_and_recycling/recycling_and_refuse_sites/townmead_road/book_slot_townmead).*

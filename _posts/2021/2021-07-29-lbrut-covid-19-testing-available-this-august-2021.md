People who are displaying symptoms of COVID-19, or have had a positive lateral flow test, are reminded that they can also get tested at the temporary testing centre in Old Deer Park on selected dates this August.

In addition to the drive-in testing centre at Twickenham Stadium and walk-in centre in Teddington, the PCR tests are being offered to anyone with coronavirus symptoms or those who have had a positive lateral flow test. See below for the dates.

You must not turn up without an appointment - those who have not booked will not be tested.

[The main symptoms of the disease are](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/):

- A high temperature - this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
- A new, continuous cough - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
- Loss or change to your sense of smell or taste - this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal

[More information on being tested and how to book your test.](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested)

Please note, if Richmond is not shown as one of the options when you book, please try again later.

Leader of Richmond Council, Cllr Gareth Roberts, said:

> "Over the past few weeks we have seen a huge rise in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the borough. This is because the Delta Variant spreads very easily.

> "It is therefore important that everyone regularly takes a lateral flow test, ideally twice a week, to make sure that they are COVID-free, and if they test positive, or start displaying symptoms, they take action immediately. That means self-isolating and requesting a PCR test.

> "If we are able to identify all those with COVID-19 - even those without symptoms - we should be able to restrict further spread of the virus."

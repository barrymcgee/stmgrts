The annual fair for residents aged 55 and over will take place online on  Friday 1 October 2021 from 10am to 3.30pm with various activities and informal  talks to choose from.

To support the Online Fair, Richmond Council awarded funding via the Full  of Life Fund to organisations in the borough who work with residents aged  55 and over and who wanted to bring people together to celebrate Silver  Sunday - the national day for older people.

There are various free events happening across the borough including a sing-along session, open days with taster classes at various  social centres, dance fitness classes, afternoon teas and arts and crafts.

The Full of Life Online Fair is a chance to access important information to  support residents to live healthy and happy lives in their later years.  Residents will need access to a computer or a tablet to attend and will  then have a choice of two sessions throughout the day. There will be access  to a chat function as well as the ability to ask any private questions  directly to the host of the session. Talks and activities include:

- An introduction to Lasting Power of Attorney and Wills
- Tips on self-care whilst looking after a loved one
- Understanding the importance of nutrition
- The latest on health care and vaccines
- How technology can help with independent living
- Preventing type 2 diabetes
- Chair yoga

Cllr Piers Allen, Lead member for Adult Social Care and Health and Chair of  the Richmond Health and Wellbeing Board, said:

> "There is something for everyone at the Full of Life Online Fair and it  will be a great opportunity to understand a little more about the support  available to residents aged 55 and over. Please register your attendance so  that you get a link to join the event on Friday 1 October.

> "I'm really pleased we have been able to support organisations wanting to  host their own in-person events to celebrate Silver Sunday through the Full  of Life Fund and I look forward to hearing about how they go!"

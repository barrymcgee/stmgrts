*Pedal Up are running Cycling Courses over the October Half Term weeks.*

Our courses cover the Level 2 National Standards and prepare students to ride on the road safely by teaching them about correct road positions, observational skills, priorities at junctions and communicating with other road users.

An off road playground course is being introduced this autumn and is for children who need to improve their control and skills such as signalling before cycling on the road.

Pedal Up instructors are experienced and fully qualified.

Many people come to Richmond Park to enjoy its wonderful trees and I thought you might like to know about two new videos that we've just produced.

The first, The Remarkable Trees of Richmond Park, is a 15-minute short film with Clare Balding interviewing Richmond Park Manager Simon Richards and Tree officer Gillian Jonusas.

There is also a fun 2-minute video showing how we help to protect Richmond Park's beautiful veteran trees.  The time-lapse short shows craftsmen constructing beautiful chestnut fencing in extra quick time... and all set Chopin's Minute Waltz!

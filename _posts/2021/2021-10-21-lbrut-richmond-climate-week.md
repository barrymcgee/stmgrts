*Richmond Climate Week will take place from 1 to 7 November 2021*

Richmond Climate Week aims to help residents, businesses and communities  better understand how to reduce their carbon footprint, highlight local  climate projects and inform residents how to get involved in tackling  climate change in our community.

Each day of Richmond Climate Week will focus on a specific theme covering  topics such as food, waste and recycling, energy saving, transport and air  quality, net zero, nature, habitats and biodiversity and much more.

Room for Work is an employability course designed for skilled workers at all levels, including managers and professionals.

Room for Work's 12-week course helps participants to learn current job search techniques with an emphasis on networking, developing social media skills, improving CVs, and practising competency-based interviews.

If you are a mature professional struggling to get back into work or you know you are under-employed and are seeking a better job this is the programme for you. At Room for Work, you will be with other jobseekers in a  friendly and supportive environment.

Classes are free and delivered via Zoom. The next programme begins next  Tuesday 20 April and runs each Tuesday from 10.30 am to 1 pm.

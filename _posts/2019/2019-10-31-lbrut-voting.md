With a General Election scheduled for Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> December the borough's electoral services team are ready to make sure everyone who is entitled to vote or intends to stand for Parliament is able to do so.

People wishing to stand in the election must submit their nominations to the Acting Returning Officer by 4pm Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> November.

A full list of candidates will be formally published once this deadline has passed. Residents who are not already on the electoral register must register by midnight on Tuesday 26<sup>th</sup> November.

People who receive and pay council tax bills are not automatically included on the register.

People can check if their name appears on the register by completing the form available here: [www.richmond.gov.uk/elections_voting_and_registration](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/elections_voting_and_registration)

Residents who are registered and would like a postal vote are being advised that they must submit their applications by 5pm Tuesday 26<sup>th</sup> November. People who are already permanently registered for a postal vote will not need to apply again. British citizens, along with citizens of qualifying Commonwealth countries, the Republic of Ireland and British Overseas Territories are all eligible to vote in this election.  In addition, those British citizens who live overseas and are registered as overseas electors will be able to vote.

Ahead of polling day all registered voters will receive a polling card showing them the location of their polling station. The cards are not actually required to vote. If they are lost or mislaid people will be able to find where their local polling station is in the days running up to the election by keying in their full postcode at [www.richmond.gov.uk/myrichmond](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/myrichmond)

On 12<sup>th</sup> December polling stations will be open between 7am and 10pm. The counting of votes for the borough's two Parliamentary constituencies of Richmond Park and Twickenham will commence that night, with the results expected to be announced in the early hours of 13<sup>th</sup> December.

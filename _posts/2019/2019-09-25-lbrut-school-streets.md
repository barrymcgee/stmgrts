A consultation will be launched on introducing a pilot programme of School Streets, following requests from concerned parents about road safety.

As part of Richmond Council's continued campaign for a greener and safer borough, it was agreed at last night's Transport and Air Quality Committee to move forward with individual consultations on three pilot School Streets in the borough.

School Streets are part-time pedestrian and cycle only zones outside schools for up to one hour each at school opening and closing times.  With an aim to improve road safety, enable walking and cycling to and from school and reduce exposure to air pollution for school children.

Residents of the road(s) concerned will continue to be allowed to make necessary vehicle movements

Monday night's committee agreed to consult with local people on piloting the scheme at St Stephen's C of E Primary School. It is also hoped that schemes can be agreed with Barnes Primary School and Stanley Primary School subject to further engagement with these schools. These schools are already actively involved in the TfL Sustainable Travel Active Responsible Safe programme (STARS).

Following successful pilots of the School Streets initiative, other schools in the borough would be encouraged to apply for future deployments.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Richmond Council Transport and Air Quality Committee, said:

> "School Streets really help improve the experience of our young residents when walking and cycling to school.  By making the areas just outside the school gates that little bit more welcoming to all those that embrace more sustainable forms of transport we hope to support more and more parents in making the switch away from unnecessary car journeys."

> By significantly reducing car movements around schools, we know that road safety and air quality should improve.  I am eager for us to work with local residents and schools to get these pilots underway and move to future rounds of School Streets, which will benefit thousands of local children and young people."

The School Streets consultation will go ahead later this year.

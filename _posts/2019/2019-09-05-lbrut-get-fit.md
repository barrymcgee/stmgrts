With the summer holidays now over, it's time to focus on getting fit and losing weight this autumn with a new men's weight-loss programme, delivered in partnership with Brentford FC Community Sports Trust.

Earlier this year, Richmond Council and Brentford FC Community Sports Trust trialled a new programme to help men aged between 30 and 60 and have a BMI 25  to get fit and lose weight.

Over the 12-week programme, 20 local men took part. They attended one session a week at Hampton Sports and Fitness Centre, receiving indoor and outdoor group fitness sessions, healthy eating workshops, and top tips for lifestyle changes.

At the end of the course, the men had collectively lost an average of half a stone and with a free one month membership to the borough's Feel Good Fitness programme, they all had the encouragement to continue on their new health and fitness journey.

Applications for the 2019 programme are now open. The programme costs just &pound;5 a week. Due to its success the course this time will be running two separate sessions .at Teddington Sports and Fitness Centre on Wednesdays 7:30pm to 9:30pm and Thursdays 7pm to 9pm.

The Wednesday session starts on October 2<sup>nd</sup> and the Thursday session starts on October 3<sup>rd</sup>.

Steve from Twickenham was one of the first to sign up. He said:

> "After completing this programme, I feel a lot better being lighter and more agile, and I actually enjoy exercise now!

> The best part of the programme was the other participants and the coaches; everyone helped everyone else and the coaches had good tips on a better diet and how to exercise."

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing Committee, said:

> "Nationally, six out of ten men are considered overweight. Lifestyle choices such as poor diet and lack of physical activity can lead to an increased risk of chronic illness and an early death. However, obesity is preventable.

> This programme is a great opportunity for men who are looking to shed the pounds and get fitter and healthier to work with the support of qualified trainers.

> Twice a week, men will come together and have fun, either playing team sports or learning about sensible dietary and lifestyle choices. And it is affordable.

> I encourage any man eligible to consider signing up. As Steve has shown us, the programme works."

Residents looking to get fit and healthy this year can also sign up to the Council's Feel Good Fitness Membership which gives you access to over 200 classes, 4 pools and five gyms with tailored services and qualified instructors on hand to help with your fitness goals.

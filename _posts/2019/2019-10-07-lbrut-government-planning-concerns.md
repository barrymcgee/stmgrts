New rights to allow two-storey upward extensions on family homes without planning permission would be a disaster and could leave neighbours powerless, says Richmond Council.

In 2013 the Government relaxed planning rules for smaller, residential extensions without the need for planning permission. Following on from this, the Government has now announced plans to extend Permitted Development rights even further, enabling homeowners to add an extra two storeys to their home without seeking planning permission.

These proposals have been described by the highly respected Royal Town Planning Institute as compounding "the disaster of low-quality housing created under previous extensions to permitted development"

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee, said:

> "We already have sub-standard flats being created from offices under previous Government relaxations of Planning rules, now we have the prospect of neighbours and the Council being powerless to object to or prevent ill-judged carbuncles on top of blocks of flats or individual houses. We will vigorously oppose these ill-conceived proposals".

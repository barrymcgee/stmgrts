The South London Partnership boroughs, which includes Richmond Council, has been awarded [&pound;4m for Internet of Things project](https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/node/34496) which will help people live better, healthier lives through better transport, environment, health and other areas while also improving business retention and sustainable economic growth.

The South London Partnership (SLP), a group of five boroughs, has been awarded &pound;4 million by London Councils to develop and deliver a sustainable multi-purpose Internet of Things (IoT) platform which involves connecting various sensors across borough boundaries. The project will bring together technology and places to create spaces that address challenges in our communities and opportunities to help people live better, healthier lives and live independently for longer. It could also deliver significant savings to borough budgets.

Funds from the London Business Rates Pilot have been awarded to the Partnership, which comprises the councils of Croydon, Kingston, Merton, Richmond and Sutton, as part of the 2018-19 Business Rate Retention Strategic Investment Pot (SIP) which is administered by the City of London Corporation.

The project will use IoT to obtain new data insights using internet-connected sensors, with minimal human intervention.

Examples of the type of insight that IoT projects can bring, are:

- Being able to understand where people travel to and from, the routes they take, and what times they make their journeys
- Support planning to build the right type of safer and happier communities and enable regeneration
- Insight into where and when people visit certain locations
- Combining air quality and location data to see how many people's health is affected in certain areas. This can help local authorities make plans to reduce pollutants, resulting in cleaner and healthier places
- Ultimately, we also need to change the way we live our lives - people must better engage with their environment to make it more sustainable for future generations
- Ability to monitor the impact of our lives on the environment (e.g. waste and air pollution)

Cllr Robin Brown, Leader Member for Finance at Richmond Council, said:

> Richmond Council is committed to becoming an engaging, open and innovative Council that has better local schools, is safer and greener and one that is fair and more affordable for all. In doing so we plan to learn from best practice elsewhere and bring fresh ideas and approaches to the borough.

> This funding will enable Richmond, along with the other boroughs in the South London Partnership to deliver an exciting and innovative project that will trial the benefits of IoT - pointing the way for further investment to transform and improve services for local residents and businesses."

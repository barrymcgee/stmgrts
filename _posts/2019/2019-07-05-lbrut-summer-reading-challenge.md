The borough's youngest readers should get ready for an out-of-this-world summer as Richmond Libraries head into space for the Summer Reading Challenge!

Space Chase is this year's Summer Reading Challenge for those children aged from 4 to 11 years and takes place from 13 July through to 14 September 2019.

Inspired by the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first moon landing, children will join The Rockets, our super space family on a thrilling mission to track down books nabbed by mischievous aliens!

Participants will receive their very own Space Chase mission folder to get them started. Read six library books (or more) over the holidays to collect special stickers to add to your folder. Collect all the stickers to find the aliens, save the missing books and complete the Challenge.

Space Chase will feature bespoke artwork from top children's illustrator, Adam Stower, and will celebrate adventure, exploration, reading and fun!

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council's spokesperson for Culture said:

> "The moon landing captured the hearts and minds of people across the world fifty years ago, and this summer our youngest readers can relive the magic of space by taking part in the Summer Reading Challenge 2019.

> "Join the Rockets on their mission to track down the books this summer, read six books and collect your certificate and medal for completing the challenge!"

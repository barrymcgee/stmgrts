Richmond Council has pledged to plant thousands of additional trees over the next five years, a move that will boost the borough's air quality and ensure the Borough remains as one of greenest in London.

The programme will see an increase in the numbers of trees we have in the borough and as well as bringing the associated environmental benefits will also make our streets and parks even better places to be.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee, said:

> "We are fortunate that our borough is one of London's greenest areas. We already have around 18000 street trees and 500 hectares of green space.

> "Tree planting has so many environmental benefits and is an important part of our efforts to tackle the climate emergency both in terms of reducing net carbon emissions and absorbing pollutants. We will particularly look at areas around the borough that have fewer trees or worse air quality.

> "Whilst increasing the number of trees goes some way to tackling climate change, it is also important that we continue to do our bit to reduce the amount of emissions in the first place."

In our fast-paced world, tired and stressed can feel like the new 'normal'.  Juggling family, work and the constant stimulation of technology and social media can affect our health and sleeping patterns, leaving many of us feeling overwhelmed and lacking in energy.

This 5-week programme uniquely combines Solomon Yogalates (Yoga and Pilates) and REST Method mindfulness techniques, channelling together Eastern and Western wellbeing practices to help keep your head above water in the muddy waters of the day to day.

Not only will you receive face to face support by expert practitioners in their fields, you'll also gain lifetime access to several fun and manageable online home practices led by the very same teachers you will be working with in person every week.

By adopting our 'little and often' approach to creating a sustainable home practice, you will learn tools to adapt mindfully to change and let go of habitual stress and tension.  Regular practice helps you feel calmer, more relaxed and grounded, not just on your days off, but every day.

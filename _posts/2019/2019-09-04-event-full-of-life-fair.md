Full of Life, the annual fair for residents aged over 55 in the borough, is back for 2019 and this time it's got a whole new lease of life!

We will once again be returning to RFU Stadium in Twickenham on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> October to speak to local professionals about health options, social care and making the most of digital devices like tablets and smart phones. There will be a free lunch, free refreshments and a range of workshops.

Visitors can try activities including tango and yoga, as well as listen to talks and take part in a number of arts and crafts sessions, ranging from painting to sewing. A new addition to the event this year is the relaxation and wellbeing room, offering a quiet space for residents to take part in guided meditations and relaxation sessions.

And for the first time, we are extending the programme to help people explore opportunities to get involved in their local communities and activity groups through a series of mini fairs around the borough.

The Council, with support from Richmond Council for Voluntary Services (RCVS), will be hosting four Community Action mini fairs in the two weeks either side of the main fair:

Hampton, Greenwood Centre - Monday 23 September, 1-4pm
Twickenham, Age UK Richmond Wellbeing Centre - Thursday 26 September, 1-4pm
Richmond, RHACC - Thursday 10 October, 1-4pm
Barnes, Kitson Hall - Friday 11 October, 11am-2pm

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of Richmond Council's Adult Social Services, Health and Housing Committee said:

> "We are delighted to once again invite our residents aged 55 and over to join us for a day full of fun, full of information and, yes, full of life!

> We know a large majority of our residents retire in excellent physical health and with a wealth of skills that could make a huge difference to the work that goes on in our borough's communities.

> So, for the first time we will be complimenting the main event at the RFU with a series of mini fair roadshows where residents can be matched with local groups and find out what volunteer opportunities are available, at all levels of commitment."

> I look forward to seeing you all there on Friday 4<sup>th</sup> October, and also at one of the mini fairs!"

Registration to attend opens on 2<sup>nd</sup> September 2019. Find out more by visiting [www.richmond.gov.uk/full_of_life](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/full_of_life)

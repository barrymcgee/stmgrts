Environment Trust, a nature and heritage conservation charity based in South West London, is running its second Clothes Swap on Saturday 19<sup>th</sup> October and is appealing to people to donate clothes and attend this afternoon of fun, fashion advice and more.

Environment Trust is asking people to donate between four and ten clothing or accessory items and swap them for the same number of 'new' items. A treasure trove awaits thanks to a surplus of donations (more welcome too)! Tickets for the event support the charity's vital conservation work and cost &pound;8 per person (&pound;5 for members of Environment Trust).

A survey earlier this year from waste management agency BusinessWaste.co.uk highlighted the growth in the UK's second hand item market, as a result of consumers becoming more conscious about sustainability and the negative impact of fast fashion on the environment.

It found almost half (45 percent) of people said they would buy pre-owned clothes, and while only 20 percent said they currently buy second-hand clothes on a regular basis, a large majority said they could be convinced to.

Sophie Norden, Fundraising and Partnership Manager at Environment Trust, says,

> "As the second largest polluter in the world, the fashion industry needs revolutionising. Everyone can do their little bit to protect the environment and swapping clothes is one way that people can play their part."

> "Our first clothes swap was successful with up to 40 people attending and going home with new items for their wardrobe. We hope our October event will attract even more people to come along, donate and go home with a new outfit, ready for their Saturday night or Sunday day out."

Environment Trust encourages clothes donations in advance at the ETNA Centre, 13 Rosslyn Rd, St Margarets in Twickenham, TW1 2AR (kindly named if participating and, if possible, on hangers).

Clothes for all the ages and genders are welcome, and donated clothes should be washed and in good condition. Clothes will also be accepted on the night and additional items welcome for a 'to purchase' rack.

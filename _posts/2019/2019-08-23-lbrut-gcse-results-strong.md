Richmond Council has congratulated local schools following the publication of this year's GCSE results - with excellent outcomes maintained or improved upon in most schools.

Provisional figures show that 78% of pupils achieved a grade four or above in English and Mathematics, which is roughly equivalent to the old C grade or above. This represents a 6% point increase since last year and is well above the 2019 national average of 66%. 56% of pupils also secured a 'good' pass in both subjects, achieving a grade 5 or above.

In addition to the improvements seen in English and mathematics, performance in other subject areas has also remained strong. 77% of all pupils entered into history or geography achieved a grade 4 or above, while 82% of those entered into a language did so, both above 2018 national averages of 62% and 70% respectively.

Cllr Penny Frost, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Schools, said:

> I would like to congratulate everyone who picked up their results yesterday. The strength of these results show another excellent year for education in Richmond upon Thames and are testament to the hard work of schools, teachers and tutors and their pupils. "They should all be very proud of their achievements - particularly with the additional challenge of changes to the grading system.

> These grades are a credit to the students and all those who have supported them, and I wish them the best of luck for the future."

Residents are invited to have their say on a new strategy aimed at preventing violence against women and girls.

The Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy seeks to tackle domestic violence and abuse, sexual violence, female genital mutilation, so-called 'honour-based' violence, forced marriage and stalking and harassment.

Violence against women and girls (VAWG) are serious crimes which have a huge impact on people's lives, the economy, health services, and the criminal justice system.

The three-year plan, developed by the Richmond Community Safety Partnership, aims to reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls; build the skills and capability of local organisations to provide effective advice and support services; reduce serious harm resulting from violence against women and girls; and increase the number reported offenders brought to justice.

Survivors of violence and abuse, families and friends, individuals or organisations working with survivors or perpetrators, or anyone with views in general, are being encouraged to have their voices heard in the development of the strategy.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "The Council and local organisations have been working extremely hard to tackle the issues of domestic violence against women and girls.

> Research suggests that incidents of domestic and sexual violence, forced marriage, so-called 'honour-based' violence and female genital mutilation are still under-reported; through this strategy, we want to raise awareness of the issues, encourage individuals and communities to report cases to the authorities and further improve services available to them.

> We would like to encourage as many people to take part in this consultation and help us develop an approach that benefits everyone affected by domestic abuse and violence."

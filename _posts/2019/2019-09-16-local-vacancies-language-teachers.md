For over 25 years Joy Jermy has run an incredibly successful business delivering language classes in many exclusive nurseries and primary schools in Richmond, Twickenham, Teddington and nearby.

Joy's classes are extremely sought-after and as a result she is now looking for both French and Spanish speakers to help and support classes in particularly in the Richmond/Sheen area.

If you have a passion for languages, combined with an enthusiasm for teaching young children then you could be the perfect addition to her team.  Email your C.V, along with a covering letter, to:  [joy@joyforlanguages.co.uk](mailto:joy@joyforlanguages.co.uk)

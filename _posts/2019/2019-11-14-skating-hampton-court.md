Prepare to be swept away by the seasonal atmosphere of Hampton Court Palace this Christmas as the stunning ice rink returns for another year.

Join us to skate against a backdrop of one of the greatest palaces on earth – Henry VIII's historic home, Hampton Court Palace. The open-air ice rink epitomises the very best in festive fun.

Be transported to one of the country's most scenic skating settings, with spectacular views of the Thames-side Tudor palace.

Located in front of the palace, our stunning ice rink offers something for everyone, from novice to expert. Enjoy a daytime skate, perhaps followed by a visit to the palace, or soak in the ambience of an evening session, when the historic Tudor gate is bathed in light.

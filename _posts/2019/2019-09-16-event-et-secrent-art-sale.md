Richmond artist Anne Swankie has also donated a fantastic painting entitled, 'The National Gallery London'. Anne trained at Richard School of Art and has taken part in shows and exhibitions by the Society of Women Artists and the Society of Landscape Painters and the Pastel Society Annual Exhibition. The opening bid for Anne's painting is &pound;300.

A stunning oil painting entitled, 'Dusk Petersham Nursery' has been donated by Lee Campbell, a professional fine artist and qualified tutor who lives on Eel Pie Island in Twickenham, with bids starting at &pound;200.

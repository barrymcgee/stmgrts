Unique gift stalls and festive market at Orleans House Gallery's Christmas Shopping Weekend

Embrace the festive spirit at this year's Christmas Shopping Weekend at Orleans House Gallery on Saturday 30 November and Sunday 1 December, which is bigger and better than ever before!

This year's event will have an outdoor market, as well as indoor shopping, to offer plenty of choice when it comes to finding the perfect gift for loved ones.

There will be over 30 local designers and London-based independent makers including designer homeware by Snowdon Flood, silk scarfs by Emily May and children's toys by Clockwork Soldier.

To fully embrace the Christmas spirit, there will also be festive music, free art activities to keep younger visitors occupied, in addition to mulled wine and delicious festive treats from the newly re-opened Stables Cafe.

Emma Cookson, Art Service Manager, said:

> "Many people feel the need to head into the City to visit Oxford Street to do their Christmas shopping where the crowds are enough to make even the most festive shopper say bah humbug.

> "So, why not enjoy the relaxing festivities at Orleans House Gallery, support local business and buy unique gifts this Christmas."

The event is free and runs from 12 - 5pm. For more information visit [www.orleanshousegallery.org/events/auto-draft-8](https://www.orleanshousegallery.org/events/auto-draft-8/)

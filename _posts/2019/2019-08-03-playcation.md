Families in Richmond upon Thames don't need to go far to enjoy their summer vacation with a free and playful event at Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham.

'Playcation' is a free event taking place from 12pm to 4pm on Sunday 4 August 2019. There will be fun for the whole family with interactive experiences, exciting exhibitions, workshops and food and drinks stalls.

Travel fifty years into the future with our Virtual Reality Experience: Terra Firma. Explore the tunnels and structures of a plastic maze as artist Georgia Tucker ponders what the future holds if we don't reduce our plastic consumption.

You can join Lucy Cran and Bill Leslie to help create an immersive art installation which encourages people of all ages to add their contribution to the exhibition. Or for the more relaxed at heart, you can enjoy a painting session with natural dyes and botanical inks to create your unique design.

Journey into the main gallery for an interactive trail through Grottofying, the Gallery's Summer exhibition, and finally over to the Stables Gallery to explore the lab of Dr Srongarm in The Overview Effect.

Food and drink will be provided throughout the day by Surrey Ices UK, OhGreekalicious and Real Ale.

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council's spokesperson for Culture said:

> With long summer holidays families are often looking for things to do together. And there's no need to look too far - why not make your vacation a staycation and join Orleans House Gallery for a great day out!"

Readers in Richmond upon Thames are being encouraged to try out the library services' e-book lending service, free of charge, as part of the 2019 Cityread promotions.

Set up an Overdrive e-book account via the LIBBY app during the month of May using the code 'CITYREAD2019' and get free access to the full collection of e-books for two months.

Once your free two months are up you will be asked if you would like to join Richmond Library's e-service for continuing free access.

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council's lead member for culture said:

> "Our libraries' Overdrive service is an easy way to get access to thousands of e-books to read on the go. As part of Cityread 2019 you have the opportunity to try out this free, on-demand service and see if it is something you'd like to continue using long-term."

[Download the Libby app from the app store onto your Android or iOS device](https://meet.libbyapp.com/).

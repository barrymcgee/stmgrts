Following the Bank Holiday on Monday 26 August, Richmond Council will carry out waste and recycling collections (including Garden Waste collections) for domestic properties one day later than usual.

For example, Monday collections will take place on Tuesday and Friday collections on the Saturday. There will be no change for those receiving commercial waste and recycling collection services.

Normal domestic collection schedules will resume a week later on Monday 2 September. Residents are asked to put recycling or refuse out by 6am on the morning of the collection day, but not to leave it on the streets the day before to avoid bags being ripped and to keep roads clean and tidy.

Waste should be put out in securely tied sacks or in a bin with a lid which assists with preventing animal attacks and people adding litter.

The Household Waste and Recycling Centre at Townmead Road will be open on the bank holiday Monday and will be operating Sunday hours - 9.00am to 4.00pm with last admission at 3.45pm.

Changes to collection days also apply to garden waste.

For all enquiries about collections, please telephone 020 8891 1411. Further information is available at [www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling)

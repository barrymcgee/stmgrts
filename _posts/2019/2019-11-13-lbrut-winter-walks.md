A programme of winter health walks has been launched by Richmond Council to encourage people to get out and about and enjoy the winter beauty of the borough, whilst staying fit and healthy.

Richmond Health Walks are one of a range of free healthy lifestyles services on offer for local residents as part the Richmond Lifestyles Service, commissioned by the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Each week already over 180 walkers take part.

Walks are short and over easy terrain and are open to everyone but are especially aimed at those who are least active.

Seven weekly walks are supported by a team of friendly, specially trained volunteers who are on hand to provide encouragement and support, and make sure no one gets left behind.

Many walkers start walking to improve their health but find it easy to keep coming back because of all the new friends they've made. As well as all the physical health benefits, Walking for Health is also great for your social life!

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing, said:

> "Being physically active is proven to be good for physical and mental health. Simply going for a daily walk is good for you and having a group to go with can help to reduce issues like social isolation. We want more people to enjoy a longer life in good health. The Healthy Walks programme is a great way to stay healthy and meet people. There are walks all over the borough so you can find a local one or join in others."

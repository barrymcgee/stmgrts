Discover local wildlife with nature experts at a fun & educational event for the whole family at Kilmorey Mausoleum wildlife garden, on Sunday 21<sup>st</sup> July 2019 from 10am to 3pm.

Environment Trust, a charity based in South West London, is [running an open day](https://www.environmenttrust.org/Event/kilmoreys-wild-neighbours) at the Grade II listed Kilmorey Mausoleum in St Margarets for people to discover the wonderful wildlife in the area and learn about the mausoleum on a guided tour.

Visitors will be able to go on an adventurous nature trail through the wildlife garden, learn about the vital work bees and hedgehogs do from nature experts and make a mini-bee-nursery for their garden to expand their habitat.

Rich in history, the mausoleum was built by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Earl of Kilmorey in 1854 in memory of his mistress and life partner, Priscilla.  He moved it with his household several times before landing at Gordon House in Twickenham.

Visitors will have the opportunity to go inside the splendid mausoleum and learn about the secret tunnel that was the subject of much mystery and rumour for many years over its existence, until [it was discovered in 1966](https://stmargarets.london/archives/2017/01/tunnel-of-love-under-kilmory-road.html).

Berny Simcox, CEO of Environment Trust says;

> "This is a wonderful family-friendly event for people to learn about the hidden wildlife on their door step from nature experts. It's also a rare chance to go inside the mausoleum and discover all about its fascinating history.

> "This is one of a series of events that we run throughout the year that raises money for the important nature and heritage conservation work we do. It's also a great opportunity for us to engage with local people and awaken their curiosity in their neighbourhood."

The event takes place on Sunday 21<sup>st</sup> July 2019 from 10am until 3pm at Kilmorey Mausoleum,  275 St Margarets Road, Twickenham, TW1 1PN.

The entrance fee is &pound;3 per person. There is a small additional charge for materials for anyone wanting to make a bee nursery. Coffee, tea and delicious homemade cakes will be available, as well as lots of raffle prizes.

There is unrestricted parking in the area all day and all proceeds will support Environment Trust's nature and heritage conservation work.

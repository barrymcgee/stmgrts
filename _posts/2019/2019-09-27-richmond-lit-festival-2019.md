The 28<sup>th</sup> Richmond upon Thames Literature Festival will take place throughout November, with another stellar line-up of writers, broadcasters, historians, new talent and activities for all ages.

The main programme will feature, among others: London mudlark Lara Maiklem discussing her treasure trove of finds from the banks of the River Thames, writer & journalist Zeba Talkhani charting her experiences growing up in Saudi Arabia and her journey to find freedom, plus take your pick from some of our finest historians: Alison Weir, Antonia Fraser, Kate Williams, Tracy Borman, Katie Hickman and Bettany Hughes, all appearing at this year's festival.

Other programme highlights include:

- Number 10's first ever Researcher in Residence, Jack Brown going behind one of the world's most iconic doors to the heart of British politics
- Journalist Amelia Abraham exploring the myths and realities of life for LGBTQ  people today
- Something in the Shadows- a deliciously gothic evening with novelists Stacey Halls, Jess Kidd and Michelle Paver taking place in the famous 'gloomth' of Strawberry Hill House
- Award-winning writers and mental health professionals Nathan Filer & Joanna Cannon debunking myths and challenging assumptions on what it means to be mad
- Former Superintendent of Southwark Mortuary shares his thrilling memoir of death and dirty dealings in a London Morgue
- BBC TV Presenter Babita Sharma reflects on her childhood growing up above a corner shop and takes a poignant look at our nation of shopkeepers
- Cheesemonger Ned Palmer uncovers the histories of our most beloved cheeses on a mouth-watering journey through time and... cheese

There is also a fantastic programme of activities for families: a specially curated event celebrating 19<sup>th</sup> century fossil finder Mary Anning, a fantasy writing workshop with Steve Feasey, and children's illustrator Laura Ellen Anderson's wondrous creations Amelia Fang & Evil Emperor Penguin battling it out in a riotous afternoon of live drawing and story-telling!

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Culture for Richmond Council, said:

> "We hope the festival hits another gear this year. To celebrate our 28<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the programme this year is particularly special.

> More venues than ever before will be hosting the programme; libraries across the borough, The National Archives and the Bingham Riverhouse, the list goes on.

> The borough is a beautiful place to spend a winter's evening and the calibre of authors and artists appearing offer something for everyone.

> We are also keen to make sure young people can join in, so we have a range of classes for children and families.

> I look forward to getting to as many of these events as I can and I would encourage you to find out what is on offer."

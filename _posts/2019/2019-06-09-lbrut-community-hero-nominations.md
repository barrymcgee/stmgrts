Do you know inspirational individual, group, or business whose heroic efforts make this borough a better place to live and work? Well we want to know them to!

Nominations for 2019's Community Heroes' Awards are open. It's a chance for us to highlight and celebrate the commitment of the people and groups living and working in Richmond upon Thames, who improve the lives of our communities and represent the borough with pride and excellence.

Awards will once again be offered in specific categories, to reflect the breadth of voluntary work being done in your communities. Winners will be recognised for their heroic achievements in everything from sporting activities and community events to care giving.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Vice Chair of Richmond Council's Finance, Policy and Resource Committee said:

> "We are incredibly lucky to live in a borough with so many individuals and groups who commit themselves to improving the lives of people who live and work in their communities without expecting anything in return.

> "Now is our chance to recognise these community heroes and thank them on behalf of the whole borough. If you know someone who has gone that extra mile we'd like to hear their story, so get in touch and nominate them for one this year's awards."

Visit [www.richmond.gov.uk/community_heroes](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_heroes) to submit your nomination for any category before 10pm on Wednesday 10 July and find out more about last year's winners. You can also find hard copies of the nomination form in Civic Centre or your local library.

*The Awards Ceremony will be held on 19 September 2019.*

Stay warm this winter by visiting the Council's Winter Warmth webpage for helpful tips and links to support services.

The page includes information on heating grants, tips for staying warm, the warm home discount scheme, and free home visits and assessments.

Being cold isn't just uncomfortable, it can be very bad for your health. Sitting or sleeping in a cold room is not good for you: it can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, breathing problems, chest infections and falls or injuries.

People with existing health conditions such as heart, circulation, kidney or lung problems (e.g. asthma), diabetes, arthritis, depression and anxiety are especially vulnerable to the cold weather and are at risk. People who have a long-term health condition or disability, children, those who are pregnant and those aged 65 or over, people living with dementia or who are on a low income, are also all at risk of ill health or death if steps are not taken to reduce the risks from the cold weather.

#### Services to support Richmond residents keep warm and well this winter

Wandsworth and Richmond Assessment Point (WRAP) is a free council one-stop support service for vulnerable residents to help them stay warm for less. Advisors from Wandsworth and Richmond Assessment Point (WRAP) will visit homes to offer:

- Impartial advice on how to understand fuel bills, access tariff discounts, and how to use heating systems efficiently.
- Support for households to apply for heating and insulation grants and help them access discounts on water rates where eligible.
- Installation of free energy and water saving measures to save money and help residents stay safe and warm, including a carbon monoxide detector, LED bulbs and radiator reflector panels

Signposting and referrals to helpful local support services including health and wellbeing services such as talking therapies, lunch clubs and free smoke alarms and advice from the London fire brigade.

Shannon Katiyo, Interim Director of Public Health for Richmond and Wandsworth Councils, said:

> "Eligible households should use the help and services available to them through the Council's website to make sure heating bills don't become a struggle this winter.

> "Living in a cold home can result in illness, especially for groups of people more vulnerable to cold weather, so be prepared and take action to keep yourself, your family and your home warm and healthy."

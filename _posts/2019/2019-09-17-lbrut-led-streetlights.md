Over 7,000 street lights across the borough will be replaced with more energy-efficient LEDs from September.

By installing more LED street lights in Richmond upon Thames, the Council hopes to be able to make financial savings, whilst saving 1,000 tones of CO<sub>2</sub> each year.

In 2016 the Council began a programme of replacing the concrete lighting columns and sodium street lights with new mild steel lighting columns and LED street lights. The scheme will now be extended to replace all remaining street lights across the borough.

The street lighting works will include the replacement of 7,000 mild steel lighting columns and 10,000 LED street lights over a period of 5 years.

The new LED street lights will be designed to be monitored by the Council's computer management software and will have much lower running costs using up to 60% per cent less energy than a conventional sodium street light. They will save 1000 tonnes of CO2 per kwh per annum.

The LED street lights will have a colour rendition of 4000k as this provides the optimum ability to reduce the lighting levels at night time and they are designed to produce the same lighting levels as the existing bulbs. There are no changes to the hours of light operation, with lights programmed to switch on at sunset and off at sunrise.

The new lights also have an average design life of 25 years, compared to about six years for traditional bulbs.

For those keen to have their street lights replaced with alternative 'Heritage' style columns, the Council is offering the opportunity for roads to request these upgrades on the basis that residents fund the additional costs.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee, said:

> "Many of our street lights are nearing the end of their life and will need replacing so it makes good sense to replace them with the latest technology. We have already replaced around 4,000 street lamps with the new energy efficient bulbs so I am delighted that we are now in a position to roll this out to every area of the borough.

> Last week we launched a consultation on our Climate Change strategy and Air Quality action plan, and this is just one of the things we are doing to become as clean and green as possible. In addition, the cost to maintain them is lower, which is a welcome benefit for local tax-payers."

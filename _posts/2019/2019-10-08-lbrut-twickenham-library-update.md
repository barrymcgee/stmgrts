Grade 2 listed Twickenham Library is set to receive some much-needed TLC over the next few months and users of the library are invited to help shape the plans.

Twickenham Library is well used and is in need of redecoration. As part of this, library staff are keen to find out more from users about what services they most value now, what they might like to see at the library in the future.

Feedback will help the team develop the library, collections and activities as part of the plans. Ideas could be around where specific collections are located, would users like to see more crime fiction, dedicated area for teenagers or more books on display. Feedback is also sought on seating types and locations, IT facilities, signage, programme of events, recycling facilities - even what flooring or cosy spaces you think would make the children's area more inspiring.

The consultation will launch on 1<sup>st</sup> October for one month. Residents can have their say online, or by attending one of the drop-in sessions or focus groups being organised at the library.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Culture and Libraries, said:

> "We value all our libraries. Many of them are based in historic buildings, that do need to be maintained. Whilst the listed status does restrict what we can do, we are keen to ensure that our facilities are fit for a 21<sup>st</sup> century library visitor.

> If you regularly use the libraries, let us know your thoughts. And, if you don't use the library - why not? Could we make some changes to encourage you to come through the door?

> In the lead up to Libraries Week next week- take ten minutes and help us plan the future of one of Twickenham's most loved local resources."

Being a trustee is a crucial and varied volunteering role and you might be surprised to find you have the skills to take it on.

Every organisation needs strong support and guidance and a Board or management committee with a diverse make-up can help ensure an inclusive perspective. Whatever your background, interests or expertise, you can make a difference in your local community.

The parking voucher system operating in Richmond upon Thames will be converted to the 'Pay by Phone' system after the company providing the vouchers went into receivership.

The affected areas are: East Sheen, East Twickenham, The Alberts, Townshend, North East Richmond, and St Margarets South.

The vouchers, purchased from authorised outlets, allowed you to park in certain parking bays in Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs) for a certain period of time. Resident visitor parking permits are not affected.

The scheme was originally implemented in the 1990s as an alternative to the provision of parking machines in these CPZs. With changes in technology more recently, 'Pay by Phone' schemes have been introduced in CPZs in line with changes already made by other Councils.

The change will be fully implemented by August 2019, with vouchers continuing to be valid for three months after that.

Further information on this change is available by visiting [www.richmond.gov.uk/voucher_parking](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/voucher_parking).

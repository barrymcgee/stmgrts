[Clarendon School](https://www.clarendon.richmond.sch.uk/) is our local special needs school.  It is based in Hampton and Twickenham but children of St Margarets would attend if their child was appropriate.

I had a child in a St Margarets school and he had to be taken out.  It was a lonely and hard time.  However my child is doing really well at Clarendon so I thought I would make a short film.  It was just a bit of fun for the school and my child Max (he plays the spaceman).  However once made, the school was really keen to get it out there to show people what a special needs school is all about.

Since going on-line three weeks age it has been watched by thousands of people on youtube and shared across Facebook.  Parents say it is a wonderful resource to help parents face the scary time of selecting a special needs school.  It also shows parents in St Margarets what their school options are.

<em>Make the pilgrimage to Clarendon Hall this Thanksgiving</em>

You won't need to journey to the New World to have a rip-roaring American Thanksgiving this November with Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, Cllr Nancy Baldwin holding our very own Thanksgiving feast in support of her charities.

We'll be serving a traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner with all the trimmings, followed by a sweet pie for dessert. And if you're not too full, dance the night away along with our live band!

Tickets cost &pound;35 per person with money raised supporting the Mayor's Charities - Home-Start and the Otakar Kraus Music Trust.

So, come along to York House from 7pm on Saturday 23 November. Tickets include a welcome drink. A cash bar is available throughout the evening.

You'll be thankful you carved out your place at our fine feast with spaces limited. Book your tickets by visiting [www.richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities).

Cllr Baldwin said:

> "I'm delighted to invite all of you along to a fabulous Thanksgiving feast. Join me at Clarendon Hall as I share one of the icons of my American heritage with turkey, pies, a live band and dancing. You'll be thankful you did!"

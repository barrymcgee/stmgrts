Why not get people together to celebrate the diversity of our world's food and at the same time raise some money for charity?

We've persuaded some people to cook a variety of delightfully succulent dishes from around the world, and so all you need to do is to turn up with some wine (or other your chosen tipple) and a donation (suggested minimum &pound;10).  **This may be the best value night out in the known Universe.**     We've also done the maths and we think we can make a goodly donation to our chosen charity if a decent number of people turn up.

But sadly, not very many people have reserved tickets so far.  And if there are insufficient people coming, then it's going to be a massive waste of food and no benefit to anyone.

[Reserve tickets now](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/international-food-and-drink-tickets-72559331915)

**So unless 30 more tickets are reserved by Monday 7 October, the event will be cancelled.**

## Can you help?

As we are a small organisation we are looking for volunteers on the day too if you can help or know anyone who might be interested, We would appreciate the request. We are looking for the following -

- Six marshals to attend water stations (2 people per station) located at 1. Hammersmith Bridge 2. Kew Bridge 3. Off Riverside Drive, Ham
- Six counters for the swimathon from 5-7pm at Hampton Pool
- Three people to volunteer to help with the BBQ, Welcome Desk and Drinks and Cake stall

We have combined the swimathon with our 'choose a challenge' event this year (see flyer attached). This is a sponsored event where people can swim, walk, cycle or run 20 miles alone or with friends/family etc. to celebrate our 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary.

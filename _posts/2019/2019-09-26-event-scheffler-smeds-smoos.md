In support of Environment Trust, the world-famous illustrator Axel Scheffler is hosting three exclusive live events for children and their parents and reading his latest creation with author Julia Donaldson 'The Smeds and the Smoos,' as well as everyone's favourite 'The Gruffalo'.

These exciting live shows will take place on Saturday 16<sup>th</sup> November at St Stephen's Church, Twickenham at 10am, 11.40am and 1.20pm.

The Smeds and the Smoos is a heart-warming tale of two alien species, the Smoos (who are blue) and the Smeds (who are red) and who never mix until they fall in love.  Set in space with charming illustrations and a lovely message about friendship, the book will inspire a love of reading in children from 3 upwards.

At the events, Axel will also be drawing his most famous characters, the Gruffalo, Stickman, Snail and the Whale...and teaching the children how to draw them too!

Alex will be signing books purchased on the day (unlimited) and books brought from home (one book per household), making it a great opportunity to buy some unique Christmas gifts for children.

Lucia Pekarova, Events Officer at Environment Trust says, "The Gruffalo has captured children's imaginations since it was first published 20 years ago. We're delighted to be giving parents and their children a rare opportunity to hear Axel Scheffler read from his new fabulous book The Smeds and Smoos and bring the glorious love story of alien folk alive.

> "At the event, people can also start their Christmas shopping with books and plenty of stocking fillers available for sale, as well as free stickers, postcards and bookmarks. Funds from the event will support local wildlife conservation and we encourage families to attend what promises to be a really magical event in the run up to the festive season."

The event is ideal for children from three years old to 12 and all children under 12 must be accompanied by an adult.

Tickets are &pound;9 for adults and children and all the proceeds from the event will enable Environment Trust to conserve wildlife and heritage in the local area.

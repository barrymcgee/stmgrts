The Department for Transport (DfT) provided an additional &pound;553k for local road maintenance and improvements in Richmond upon Thames in the last financial year.

The extra funding enabled the Council to undertake a range of localised repairs and extensive preventative works in the form of carriageway resurfacing, patch repairs and joint sealing in addition to the works carried out in our annual highway maintenance programme.

This included works at the following locations:-

- Whitton Road, St Margarets & North Twickenham Ward.
- St Margarets Road, St Margarets & North Twickenham Ward.
- Sidney Road, St Margarets & North Twickenham Ward
- Red Lion Street, South Richmond Ward.
- Priests Bridge, Mortlake & Barnes Common Ward.
- Cross Deep, South Twickenham Ward.
- Hounslow Road, Whitton Ward.
- Broom Road, Hampton Wick Ward.
- Mortlake High Street, Mortlake & Barnes Common Ward.
- Hospital Bridge Road, West Twickenham Ward.
- Sandy Lane, Teddington Ward.
- Upper Sunbury Road, Hampton Ward.
- Avondale Road, Mortlake & Barnes Common Ward.

This funding was in addition to the &pound;3.5m that was spent on highway maintenance repairs across the borough, with works including laying new pavements and resurfacing local residential roads. Over the following 12 months another &pound;3.5m will be further invested in maintaining and improving the highway network in the borough. The Council has already commenced this year's annual maintenance programme on carriageways and footways in the borough and all work will be completed by the end of March 2020.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee for Richmond Council, said:

> Investing in our roads and pavements is a priority for Richmond Council. All our roads and pavements are inspected regularly, but we know that conditions can mean that some will deteriorate rapidly between inspections.

> We are always grateful for the input of residents regarding emerging issues and we encourage any road-users to report any issues they notice using our online facilities.

> Of course, even with support from the DfT, financial resources are finite.  Rest assured all defects are recorded and Richmond Council ensure that as many repairs as possible are delivered within the means of the council's resources. We continue to look for innovations and efficiencies that can boost our work in this area, because we know how important it is to our residents."

Residents can report potholes or broken pavements on borough roads via the following links:

- [LBRuT street fault reporting](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/roads_and_transport/roads_and_road_works/road_and_pathway_maintenance/streets_fault_reporting)
Defects or faults on the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN - the 'Red Routes') can be reported to Transport for London (TfL) via the following link:-
- [TfL Roadworks and Street faults](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/roadworks-and-street-faults)
A list of those streets that are scheduled to be resurfaced or have new pavement laid is available on the Council's website
- [Planned Highway Works 2019/20](https://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/documents/s77976/LBR%20Appendix%201%20and%202%202019-20%20FINAL%20002%2025022019%20Housing%20Community%20Safety%20and%20the%20Environment%20O.pdf)
The list is not definitive as on some occasions preliminary investigations may result in some roads and/or footways not being progressed due to site conditions or works by other utilities or agencies in which case alternatives will be selected from a reserve list.

Richmond Council is asking residents to give their views on the Council's parks.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee, said:

> "We know our residents value their borough parks and we are always looking to improve them.

> "If you would like to have your say please do so by completing the survey. It is available to complete online or you can request a paper copy from the Council"

Like your food? Not as much as Queen Victoria!

Tickets are still available for a raft of events celebrating the boroughs rich and vibrant history - including a talk on The Greedy Queen!

Whilst Queen Mary was known for her love of chocolate, Queen Anne was known as the 'Brandy Nan', Queen Victoria loved all food!  Come and join Dr Annie Gray for a talk on 'The Greedy Queen'. Dr Gray will celebrate Queen Victoria's great appetite - both for food and for life.

Born in May 1819, Victoria came 'as plump as a partridge'. In her early years she lived on milk and bread under the Kensington system; in her old age she suffered constant indigestion yet continued to over-eat. From intimate breakfasts with the King of France, to romping at tea-parties with her children, and from state balls to her last sip of milk, this talk looks at a life lived through food: what she ate, when and with whom.

Voracious and adventurous in her tastes, Queen Victoria was Head of State during a revolution in how we ate - from the highest tables to the most humble. Based on Annie's recent book (copies of which she'll be happy to sign), The Greedy Queen considers Britain's most iconic monarch from a new perspective, telling the story of British food along the way.

The event is on Thursday 26 September from 7.30pm at Richmond Old Town Hall. Tickets cost &pound;10 and can be booked online.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Culture for Richmond Council, said:

> "Whilst I am a great food lover - it seems that Queen Victoria broke all records with her love for the edible! This interesting talk is just one of our events throughout September unearthing the hidden secrets of our borough.

> With something for everyone, book your tickets now!"

*Join us on a 8 weeks course journey through the chakras!*

We will start at the root, ground and connect to the earth element. The following weeks we will go up the different energy centres up to the crown and then the Aura (magnetic field).

> The criteria is that if you can practice and understand these chakras, and develop them automatically in your body so they become your companions, then you have seven friends."

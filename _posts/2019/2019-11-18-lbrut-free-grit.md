Richmond residents are once again being offered free bags of grit and rock salt as part of the Council's annual winter initiative to tackle snow and ice.

In continuation of the very positive responses over the last couple of year's issuing of free rock salt, the Council is again encouraging residents to take advantage of the Borough's community initiative.

Last year, the Council successfully issued over 850 bags of rock salt to Richmond residents, and as a result, the Council will again be offering residents the option to collect up to 50kg of rock salt from the Council's Depot in Langhorn Drive, Twickenham.

The rock salt will be available for collection from Monday 25<sup>th</sup> November until Saturday 30<sup>th</sup> November between the hours of:  Mon-Fri 9am to 3pm & Saturday 8am to 1pm.

As the depot is a secure area, you will need to sign in at the gate reception so please ensure you have photo ID and proof of address with you when you arrive.

When temperatures plummet and roads and footpaths are covered in snow and ice we send out a fleet of vehicles and many members of staff to clear it away, but with nearly 250 miles of road surface and 500 miles of pavements it is a huge task that always takes time to complete. We have to prioritise the larger roads.

Local people often tell us they are ready, willing and able to clear paths in their community - this could be outside their houses, local shops or being neighbourly and helping elderly people living close by. This is why we are continuing this annual initiative. By providing local people with the tools to do the job, we can, as a community, work together to clear away the snow and ice much more quickly.

In addition, The Council's winter gritting service which runs from October to April will continue to keep main roads clear of snow and ice and ensure entrances to important public buildings remain accessible.

Students in Richmond upon Thames school sixth forms are once again celebrating following receipt of their A Level results - with the borough seeing an increase of 2% in A* to C grades.

Yesterday's provisional results show that 84% of all the entries in borough school sixth forms achieved A* to C grades, considerably above the national average of 76%.

The proportion of entries achieving A* to B grades was similarly above the national average, as was that for the proportion achieving the top A* to A grades, which has increased to 32%. These results are particularly impressive alongside the decline to the same measure nationally.

The overall pass rate was also in line with the national average.

Cllr Penny Frost, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Schools, said:

> I would like to send my congratulations to all the students who have received their A-Level results. It is good to see that the results are up from last years and I look forward to supporting the schools as they work to drive up the grades even further.

> I wish all the students the best of luck in the future. Whether they are going onto university, employment, apprenticeship or further training - I hope you all reach your full potential."

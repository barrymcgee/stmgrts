You may be aware that the RMT union has called strike action for five consecutive days from 18 to 22 June.

It's very disappointing that the RMT union has called for more disruptive strike action. We remain committed to finding a solution that will help us build a better railway for our customers.

This action means we will have to make significant changes to the normal timetable on every route, so [please check your journey before travelling](https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/rmt-industrial-action).

We have a dedicated section on our website providing you information about the changes to the train services. so please visit the website for further details.

#### Special Events

For customers going to the following events we have highlighted the services below to ensure you can still get there.

- Royal Ascot - Additional services will operate between Waterloo and Reading during the morning and early evening to take and return passengers going to Royal Ascot.
- Hampton Court Palace music festival concerts (Tuesday to Saturday) - We will run extra trains before and after from Waterloo to Hampton Court to get customers to and from the concerts.
- Metallica concert at Twickenham (Thursday only) - The extra trains we will run on the Waterloo to Reading route can be used to get to the concert. We will also run extra trains from Twickenham to get
customers back to Waterloo after the concert.

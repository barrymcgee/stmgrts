Governors are vital to the running of the school, being responsible for strategic oversight, helping develop new initiatives, and helping the school improve and meet its targets. Orleans transitioned from an infant into a two-form primary school four years ago, and is currently rated "Outstanding" by Ofsted; the school works hard to maintain these high standards and to continue to improve.

Governors need to have the time to commit to full governors meetings (evenings), training sessions (day or evening), committee meetings (day) and school visits (school hours.) This is a great role for anyone looking to support their local community, expand their skill set, and grow the charitable section of their CV.

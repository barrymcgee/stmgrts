A new online access guide to Richmond upon Thames has been launched today.

[AccessAble](http://www.accessable.co.uk/organisations/london-borough-of-richmond-upon-thames) is aimed at making the Richmond more accessible for residents and visitors, maximising independence and choice for disabled people around the borough.

The free online guide provides access information for hundreds of venues across Richmond including shops, restaurants, leisure centres, theatres, museums, libraries and parks.

All of the venues have been visited and assessed by an AccesAble surveyor, who has looked at a whole range of accessibility features from parking to toilets.

The online guide includes information relevant for anyone with an access need, including people with mobility impairments, sensory impairments, learning difficulties and people on the autistic spectrum.  It does not label venues as "good" or "bad", or "accessible" or "inaccessible"; it provides information to let the user decide whether the venue is suitable for their own individual access needs.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Vice Chair of the Council's Finance, Policy and Resource Committee and Leader Member for Equalities, said:

> "Making our borough as accessible as possible to those with disabilities and mobility issues is a top priority for this administration. Empowering individuals to make choices is crucial for improving independence and confidence and this new guide will help residents and visitors alike.

> "We recognise that people's freedom and access are often limited by poor design and lack of information, which contributes to social isolation and prevents people from engaging with public life.

> "I hope the guide will help remove some of the barriers that some people face and in the process make Richmond upon Thames more accessible".

Lucy Burn, Chief Executive of RichmondAid, said:

> "People are disabled by the barriers in society that prevent them from having access to services, leisure activities and employment opportunities that non-disabled people take for granted.

> "This is vital information for disabled people whether planning a visit to a theatre, knowing where the accessible toilets are if they are out for a walk or shopping and also using public transport. It is great there is a guide out there listing access features for a range of venues and services and will benefits disabled people living in the borough as well as visitors to the borough."

The guide will be launched at the Voluntary Sector Forum in September, however is available online now at: [www.accessable.co.uk/organisations/london-borough-of-richmond-upon-thames](http://www.accessable.co.uk/organisations/london-borough-of-richmond-upon-thames)

Would you like the chance to buy a unique piece of art created by Dame Emma Thompson or Sir Quentin Blake for just &pound;40? Then come along to Environment Trust's annual Secret Art Sale at The Exchange, 75 London Road, Twickenham on Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> and Sunday 29<sup>th</sup> September from 11am until 5pm to view and purchase art works donated by famous celebrities.

This year's famous artists include cartoonist Sir Quentin Blake CBE best known for illustrating Roald Dahl's books, artists John Wragg RA, Norman Ackroyd CBE RA and Ken Howard OBE RA, sculptor Alison Wilding OBE RA, actors Dame Emma Thompson and Peter Davidson, poet Roger McGough CBE, and TV script writer David Harsent, along with hundreds of professional artists and local amateurs.

This is Environment Trust's fourth Secret Art Sale to raise money for the charity's nature and heritage conservation work. The art will be exhibited anonymously and sold at &pound;40, which means buyers can purchase art at an affordable price, whilst offering them the chance of owning work by a renowned artist or celebrity. The artists will only be revealed on purchase.

Last year, Environment Trust raised &pound;16,000 from the art donated by Tracey Emin CBE RA, Axel Scheffler, James Butler MBE RA, Peter Randall-Page RA, Prof Norman Ackroyd CBE RA, Helen Baxendale, Julian Clary, Deborah Meaden, David Harsent, Rob and Nick Carter and many other artists.

In total, 429 works went on sale and every penny of the profits went to improving and protecting the local environment and heritage in South West London.

Berny Simcox, Environment Trust, Event Consultant says, "We're delighted so many renowned artists have donated art. This is our flagship fundraising event of the year for Environment Trust and it is a really fun and exciting day out. It is not just for professional artists - we encourage everyone to get involved by contributing art or by coming along on the day to buy. We want to make this our best Secret Art Sale yet."

Those who contribute art works will have their details and biography promoted on Environment Trust's web site and they will be invited with a friend to the VIP artists' party on the evening of 28<sup>th</sup> September.

Environment Trust would appreciate donations of art by 13<sup>th</sup> September 2019. Anyone wishing to contribute should contact Lucia Pekarova from Environment Trust for an information pack on 07860 878462 or  [lucia.pekarova@environmenttrust.org](mailto:lucia.pekarova@environmenttrust.org).

Pupils attending primary school in Richmond upon Thames have topped the national league tables yet again following publication of the provisional 2019 Key Stage 2 (SATs) results last week.

These results mean the borough has also scored the highest in London in nearly all areas with 87% of pupils achieving the expected standard in reading, 88% in writing, 90% in mathematics, whilst 80% did so in reading, writing and mathematics combined, all considerably above the national averages.

These excellent results place Richmond first out of all local authorities nationally, for the proportion achieving the expected standard in all three subjects combined and maintain the high levels of attainment seen in recent years.

The borough also had a large proportion of pupils achieving the higher standard, with 45% of pupils in reading, 28% in writing, 47% in mathematics and 21% in all three subjects combined doing so.

Early indications of progress from the end of Key Stage 1 (Year) are also above national averages and indicate that pupils make stronger progress, on average, from their different starting points than pupils do nationally.

These results maintain the borough pupils' long held position at the top of the national league tables.

Cllr Penny Frost, Lead Member for Children's Services and Schools, said:

> "Once again, our borough's schools have outshone the rest of the country. It shows, that despite tight financial constraints, our schools continue to deliver first-class education and strive to continue to do the best for every pupil.

> Pupils, teaching staff and governors are to be congratulated for their achievements across the board. It's a ringing endorsement of the strong partnership we see between parents and schools, which have once again made a huge difference to the achievements of our pupils and marks our borough out for giving children the best possible start to life."

Marble Hill Park is running a number of 'American Doubles' tournaments this Autumn for adult improvers.

How does 'American Doubles' work?

1. You play with a different partner against different opposition in each round.
1. Each round could be a 'short set' i.e. first to 5 games wins, or it could be 'timed'
i.e. whoever has the most games after 30 minutes wins.
1. They provide an opportunity to play against others in a fun, relaxed environment.

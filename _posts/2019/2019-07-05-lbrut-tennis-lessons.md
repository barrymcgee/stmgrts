New and existing tennis players can now sign up to a family or junior's tennis membership and take advantage of the super summer tennis programme being served up in Richmond upon Thames.

Richmond Council is offering a family membership scheme which gives the whole family access to our tennis courts. There's also a junior membership package for under-16s, who can book and play tennis for free.

You'll have access to the borough's eleven tennis sites include 44 courts where you can have a social hit out, play in competitions and tournaments, and receive individual coaching.

Tennis For Kids is a course designed for 4-11 year olds, comprising of six fun beginner sessions where participants also receive a racket and ball set plus a personalised t-shirt for only &pound;25 (&pound;4.99pp). Find your nearest course by visiting [clubspark.lta.org.uk/TennisForKids](https://clubspark.lta.org.uk/TennisForKids)

Currently, six of our court sites will also have gated access where you can book times online and receive a four-digit code to give you access to the court of your choice. These include Cambridge Gardens, Sheen Common, Westerly Ware, Old Deer Park, Carlisle Park and York House Gardens.

Cllr JF Burford, Richmond Council's spokesperson for sport said:

> "The summer tennis programme is always popular with 600 members in the borough at present and there's always room for more people to get involved.

> "With Wimbledon due to start now's a great time to get on court and start a terrific summer of tennis!"

Membership is &pound;50 per annum for adults and free for under-16s.

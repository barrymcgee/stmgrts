> I have been researching the history of Crown Road (previously Crown Lane)  St Margarets and its junction with St Margarets Road and Richmond Road for the last 12 months. As a member of our local history Facebook sites - [Twickenham and Teddington Memories](https://www.facebook.com/groups/441860535947710/) and [East Twickenham and St Margarets History](https://www.facebook.com/groups/447440405413269/). I have received lots of feedback and help, not least from local historians and postcard collectors.

> Quite a lot of postcard photos exist but from time to time personal photos are turning up in family collections.  I am looking for photos of buildings, shops, houses or  if really lucky and of the market gardens around in the 1900s. If anyone feels they can help please contact me at  [rogwyer@gmail.com](mailto:rogwyer@gmail.com). I would be  very grateful to anyone who spares the time to help.

Drumming, storytelling and history is the focus of Richmond Libraries Black History Month events this October.

Black History Month is an annual commemoration of the history, achievements and contributions of black people in the UK.

At Richmond Library, author Lucy Bland will be holding an author talk about her book 'Brown Babies'. This book recounts the important but little-known history of the estimated 2,000 babies born to black GIs and white British women in the second world war.

The African-American press referred to these children as 'brown babies'. Black soldiers, in this segregated US army, were forbidden to marry their white girlfriends and nearly half of the children were given up to children's homes, but few were adopted. At the event Lucy will talk about her book, which looks at the moving stories of over fifty of these children, their stories contextualized in terms of government policy and attitudes of the time.  The event is on Saturday 12<sup>th</sup> October from 2.30pm in Richmond Library Annexe.

Later in the month at East Sheen Library, Ugandan storyteller, singer and actress, Diana Lwanga will be holding a storytelling and drumming workshop for children and their families on Monday 28<sup>th</sup> October at 4pm.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries for Richmond Council, said:

> "Black History Month is an opportunity to recognise and celebrate diversity in the borough. These two events are just a small example of the wide range of activities happening across the Capital. I hope that many people will attend the events."

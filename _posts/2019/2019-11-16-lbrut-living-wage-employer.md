Richmond Council has this week been accredited as a Living Wage Employer.

The Living Wage commitment recognises that everyone working at Richmond Council receives a minimum hourly wage of &pound;10.75. This rate is significantly higher than the Government minimum for over 25s, which currently stands at &pound;8.21 per hour. Accreditation also requires for new contractors that the Council works with also pay staff the Living Wage.

The real Living Wage is the only rate calculated according to the costs of living. It provides a voluntary benchmark for employers that wish to ensure their staff earn a wage they can live on, not just the government minimum.

Richmond Council introduced the Living Wage for all employees in 2012/13.

Paul Martin, Chief Executive of Richmond Council, said:

> "The Living Wage helps our employees to afford to live with an improved standard of living. It also helps the Council by improving staff motivation and retention, enabling us to provide better customer services.

> "We now intend to lead by example and encourage others in the borough to follow. Moving forward, we will ensure that all our contractors pay their employees the London Living Wage."

Katherine Chapman, Director, Living Wage Foundation said:

> "We're delighted that Richmond Council has joined the movement of nearly 6,000 responsible employers across the UK who voluntarily commit to go further than the government minimum to make sure all their staff earn enough to live on.

> "They join thousands of small businesses, as well as household names such as LUSH, Heathrow Airport, Barclays, West Ham Football Club and many more. These businesses recognise that paying the real Living Wage is the mark of a responsible employer and they, like Richmond Council, believe that a hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay."

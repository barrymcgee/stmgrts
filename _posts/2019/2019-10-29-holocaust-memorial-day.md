Residents, community groups, businesses and schools are invited to take part in this Richmond Council Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD) project.

HMD 2020 is particularly poignant as it is the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau and this will be a moving tribute to the millions who died.

**75 Memorials - A Community Remembers** will be an exhibition at the Landmark Arts Centre in January and anybody who lives, works or studies in the borough is invited to create and submit artworks, prose and poetry, inspired by the stories and events of the Holocaust.

Pieces can respond directly to one person's experiences, can be a broader commemoration of the Holocaust or be a reflection on the 2020 national theme: Stand Together.

Artwork can be made using any material or artist technique, including but not limited to, photography, graphic design, sculpture, pottery or drawing. There is no word limit for poetry and prose submissions, however to be considered for inclusion in the exhibition they need to be of a length that is practical to display.

Seventy-five pieces will be selected for the exhibition at The Landmark Arts Centre which will run from the 15<sup>th</sup> January-2nd February 2020. Exhibits will be chosen to show a diverse range of pieces that reflect the many different experiences of the Holocaust.

The deadline to submit work is Sunday 15<sup>th</sup> December.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "It's right that we should take the time to reflect and remember the men, women, and children who were murdered, tortured and dehumanized during the Holocaust and that we learn to celebrate the diversity of our communities.

> "We're fortunate here in the UK that we are not at risk of genocide. However, discrimination has not ended, nor has the use of the language of hatred or exclusion.

> "The exhibition at the Landmark Arts Centre will be a poignant reminder about those who died - allowing us to reflect on the atrocities of the past and share their stories with future generations. It is the best defence against history repeating itself."

Cllr Jo Humphreys, a Jewish ward councillor for Whitton, who is leading on the event, said:

> "Throughout my life I've known people who either directly or indirectly were affected by this dark period in world history and I've been privileged to meet survivors and hear them bear witness to the horrors of the Holocaust.

> "Projects like this are fundamental to ensuring that we never forget. This is especially important in the light of a 2019 survey which revealed that 5% of UK adults don't believe the Holocaust happened and 8% believe the scale of it was exaggerated.

> "This exhibition of work produced by the people of Richmond borough is a way for us to all stand together against hatred and prejudice."

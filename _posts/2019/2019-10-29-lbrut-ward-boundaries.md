The independent Local Government Boundary Commission for England is asking people across [Richmond upon Thames to comment on its draft proposals](http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/greater-london/greater-london/richmond-upon-thames) for new Council ward boundaries.

The Commission's plans would mean changes to most wards in Richmond upon Thames. The proposed changes only relate to local government ward boundaries and do not in any case come into effect until 2022. They will not have any impact on any future General Election.

An 11-week public consultation on the recommendations begins today and will end on 13 January 2020. The consultation is open to anyone who wants to have their say on new Council wards, ward boundaries and ward names across Richmond upon Thames.

The Commission's draft recommendations propose that Richmond upon Thames should have 54 councillors in future: this is no change from now. The recommendations also outline how those councillors should represent 18 three-councillor wards across the borough.

The full recommendations and detailed interactive maps are available on the Commission's website at consultation.lgbce.org.uk and [www.lgbce.org.uk.](http://www.lgbce.org.uk. )Hard copies of the Commission's report and maps will also be available to view at council buildings.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "Understanding from people which ward they think they should live in and what they are called is important. Many people have already given their views as part of the first phase of the review, but as this will shape future Council elections, I encourage all residents to have their say."

Professor Colin Mellors, Chair of the Commission, said:

> "We are publishing proposals for a new pattern of wards across Richmond upon Thames and we are keen to hear what local people think of the recommendations. Over the next 11 weeks, we are asking local people to tell us if they agree with the proposals or if not, how they can be improved.

> "Our review aims to deliver electoral equality for local voters. This means that each councillor represents a similar number of people, so that everyone's vote in council elections is worth roughly the same, regardless of where you live.

> "We also want to ensure that our proposals reflect the interests and identities of local communities across Richmond upon Thames and that the pattern of wards can help the council deliver effective local government for local people. We will consider all the submissions we receive, whoever they are from and whether your evidence applies to the whole borough or just a part of it."

The Commission wants to hear as much evidence as possible to develop final recommendations for Richmond upon Thames. If you would like to make a submission to the Commission, please write or email us by 13 January 2020.

The independent Local Government Boundary Commission for England is asking local people for their help in drawing up a new pattern of council wards for Richmond upon Thames.

The consultation is the second part of an electoral review which will re-draw ward boundaries across the borough. This follows a review earlier in the year to determine whether or not the current number of councillors is the appropriate for the borough size and population. Following this review, it was determined that there should be no change from the current arrangements of 54 elected members.

In drawing up new boundaries, the Commission aims to deliver electoral equality for voters in Council elections so that each councillor represents roughly the same number of voters. The review also aims to ensure that the new council wards reflect, as far as possible, the interests and identities of communities across Richmond upon Thames.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

"I am pleased that the Commission agrees that the size of the Council is right. However, making sure that our ward boundaries are in the right place is important. So, understanding from people which ward they think they should live in, will help the Commission with their review. I encourage all residents to have their say."

Professor Colin Mellors, Chair of the Commission, said:

> "We are asking local people and organisations to help us draw up new wards for Richmond upon Thames. As we develop the recommendations, we will take into account local community identities as well as ensuring electoral equality for voters.

> "If you have a view about which communities or neighbourhoods should be part of the same council ward, then we want to hear from you. And if you think a road, river or railway makes for a strong boundary between communities in your part of Richmond upon Thames then this consultation is for you.

> "If you're interested in the way the borough is run, just log on to our website to explore our interactive maps and have your say. Your views will make a difference.

> "We will carefully consider all evidence that is provided during this phase of the review, whoever it is from and whether it applies to the whole of Richmond upon Thames or just a small part of the borough.

> "Residents will then have a further chance to have their say after we publish our draft recommendations in October."

Local people have until 5 August 2019 to submit their views in this consultation. Further information on the review and interactive maps of the existing wards can be found at [consultation.lgbce.org.uk](https://consultation.lgbce.org.uk) and [www.lgbce.org.uk](https://www.lgbce.org.uk).

To celebrate Car Free Day on Sunday 22 September, we will be encouraging residents across the borough to apply to close their road, and encourage children to play in the streets where they live.

To encourage as many streets as possible to take part, the Council is again waiving the administration costs to the road closures, and to help inspire the play, we are again making available a number of grants of up to &pound;250 to enable neighbours to plan fun activities that will entice people out of their homes and onto the streets.

_The deadline to apply for a Play Street is Friday 23 August 2019._

Liberal Democrat members in Twickenham have overwhelmingly voted for Munira Wilson as their new parliamentary candidate, following Vince Cable's decision not to stand at the next general election.

Speaking after the standing room only members' meeting at the Exchange in Twickenham, Munira Wilson, said: 'I want to thank the Lib Dem members of Twickenham for putting their trust in me to fight the seat at the next general election. I can't wait to get out across the constituency to talk to residents and I am looking forward to the forthcoming general election campaign. We face a critical point in our country's history and the Lib Dems are very clear - we must stop Brexit - it is bad for our economy, public services and the environment.

> 'I would also like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Vince Cable, who for the last twenty years has been an outstanding MP for our area and been a towering figure nationally. It is an honour to be the candidate for the constituency he has served so well, and I look forward to building on his legacy.'

Vince Cable MP said of Munira:

> 'I'm delighted that Munira has been chosen to stand for Twickenham at the next general election. Munira will be an excellent candidate and I look forward to working with her to ensure that Twickenham remains Liberal Democrat. She is a longstanding local resident and party activist who has served on the council and worked with me on local campaigns."

Munira works in a UK board-level role for a global science and technology company. She lives in Whitton with her husband and two young children.

Munira has led campaigns such as protecting EU citizens' access to NHS care after Brexit and has a track record of campaigning with Lib Dem colleagues across the borough against Heathrow expansion.

Once described by the Richmond and Twickenham Times as a 'fighting force', she delivered road safety measures and defeated corporate giant McDonald's repeated demands for longer opening hours when she served as a West Twickenham councillor.  Munira is demanding a fairer funding deal for local schools and better mental health provision, particularly for young people. She will continue Vince's campaign to improve train services throughout the constituency.

Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> 'I am delighted that Munira Wilson has been selected. The next general election will be crucial for the future of our country, and Munira is the strong, local candidate we need. I look forward to campaigning alongside her in the coming months.'

excerpt: |
    Many people wish to write their memoirs or autobiography, or capture the ones of close family members, but either never get round to it or find it prohibitively difficult, costly and time-consuming. We've all heard loved ones telling amazing anecdotes about their lives that we'd love to capture, but ironically day-to-day life gets in the way of actually doing it.

Many people wish to write their memoirs or autobiography, or capture the ones of close family members, but either never get round to it or find it prohibitively difficult, costly and time-consuming. We've all heard loved ones telling amazing anecdotes about their lives that we'd love to capture, but ironically day-to-day life gets in the way of actually doing it.

Local company Recordalife, operating from Richmond Library Annexe and founded by long time Twickenham resident Mike Tapia, is the innovative, affordable and professional solution and, like no other, produces professional books and audio CDs and MP3 versions of the subject speaking in an interview, allowing future generations to not only read these Life Stories but also hear them in the author's own voice.

On ordering, a beautifully presented Welcome Pack arrives by courier within three days. These Welcome Packs contain a Gift Certificate and Welcome Guide, which includes full, easy to use, instructions.

The next step is to arrange a face-to-face, phone or Skype interview with one of their experienced 'Life Recorders', or oral historians, for a friendly, guided interview using their unique interview system. As a local company, Recordalife interviewers will visit local residents for no additional charge, or interviews can also take place at the Richmond office. The storyteller is encouraged to include as much information as they'd like their family and future generations to hear.

Allowing time for professional editing and proofreading, one should expect delivery of the Life Story Pack within a few weeks.  This arrives in an attractive presentation box containing high quality, full-colour hard-back books telling the author's unique story, using cherished personal photographs, along with audio recordings of the interviews.

Recordalife makes capturing life stories easy and creates a family heirloom to cherish.

The courtyard at Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham, is once again home to a charming caf&#233; serving seasonal dishes, freshly baked cakes and locally-roasted coffee.

The Stables Caf&#233; is open from 9am - 5pm on Tuesday - Sunday every week. The address is Orleans House Gallery, Riverside, Twickenham, TW1 3DJ.

Once suitably full of coffee and cake, why not visit The Stables Gallery's new exhibition? From now until January 2020, three artists are showcasing the connection between landscape and nature through drawing, painting, installation, video and performance.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "The Stables Caf&#233; is in a relatively undiscovered but wonderful part of Twickenham. In under 15 minutes, you can walk from the train station to the edge of Marble Hill Park by the River and enjoy tasty food and drink in the courtyard of Orleans House Gallery.

> "The Stable Caf&#233; team are excited to be up and running so pop in and say hello to support a new local business."

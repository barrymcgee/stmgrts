City Hall has 'called-in' the Planning decision on the redevelopment of the Homebase site in Richmond. This follows a resolution by Richmond Planning Committee to recommend refusal.

On 3 July, the Planning Committee considered an application for a mixed-use development, creating 385 homes in a four-nine storey redevelopment on the Manor Road site. Following consideration of all the representations and the officers report, the Committee recommended the application be turned down on a number of grounds. These included; failure to deliver maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing, the design and scale being visually intrusive, dominant and overwhelming; the quality of the proposed accommodation and the impact on surrounding properties.

Planning regulation dictates that developments of 150 residential units or more, or over 30 metres in height, must be referred to the Mayor of London, after the Council has made a decision recommendation.

Following a review of the Manor Road application outcome, the Mayor of London has decided to use his powers to direct that he will become the local planning authority for the application.

The Mayor believes that this development is of a nature or scale that would have a significant impact on the implementation of the London Plan policies on housing and affordable housing

The Mayor must hold a public hearing before deciding whether or not to grant planning permission.  A hearing date has yet to be set.

The Mayor of London has published details of the application on the GLA website, including their Stage 1 Report; background information on hearings and how to comment on the application.

Residents can make representations to the Mayor by emailing  [mayor@london.gov.uk](mailto:mayor@london.gov.uk).  The GLA reference is 4795.  Representations can be made up until the hearing.

Future public sectors stars can apply now to the Richmond and Wandsworth councils' Graduate Development Programme.

The programme, now in its seventh year provides graduates with a broad range of development and career opportunities.

The two-year programme offers graduates the chance to take on real opportunities in at least four different placements in key areas of the Shared Staffing Arrangement for Richmond and Wandsworth councils. This could include working in the parks department, business, children's services, housing, regeneration or adult social care.

Both councils are looking to attract innovative, adaptable and enthusiastic individuals with a commitment to public service to take part in a wide range of projects, placements and development activities.

Paul Martin, Chief Executive of Richmond and Wandsworth councils, said:

> "We're looking for talented, ambitious young people who are hungry to learn and can help both councils and the Shared Staffing Arrangement develop and improve.

> "In return, we will invest in our trainees' development and offer them the opportunities to reach their potential and many of our previous graduates are now taking their first steps into long term careers with us".

Following a 2-stage competition process and extensive public engagement, Richmond Council and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) are delighted to announce that Hopkins Architects have been selected as the preferred bidder to work with the Council on the Twickenham Riverside project by the Design Panel.

Hopkins were selected from a strong shortlist which also included:

- Allies and Morrison
- Baynes and Mitchell Architects with Outpost
- Cullinan Studio
- Haworth Tompkins

The Design Panel who selected Hopkins as the preferred bidder was comprised of the Leader of the Council, Gareth Roberts (Chair), leading Councillors for the Environment and Business, a local ward Councillor, Sarah Williams as the RIBA Adviser, a representative from the Local Stakeholder Reference Group and two local residents with architectural experience.

This decision to select Hopkins will be ratified by Richmond Council's Finance, Policy and Resources Committee meeting in January after which the official confirmation of their appointment will be made. The Committee will also be asked to approve the funding to take the project forward.

Following the decision by the Finance, Policy and Resources Committee, and successful appointment, the Council will work with the architects and wider design team on full proposals for the site. These proposals will be published for consultation as part of the Pre-Planning process and subject to the Planning Application process.

Paul Chadwick, Director of Environment and Community Services for Richmond Council, said:

> "Following four weeks of engagement, the Design Panel reviewed the feedback from residents, along with the formal considerations as set out as part of the RIBA competition process. We are delighted that an architect has been selected bringing forward designs that will not only deliver a new, revitalised Riverside that has presented a design that we will believe will not just revitalise the Riverside, but will also drive economic improvement to the wider Twickenham Area. The Council looks forward to working with Hopkins architects in the weeks and months ahead."

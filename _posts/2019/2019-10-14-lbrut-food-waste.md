As part of a week of activity across London, Richmond Council is hosting a Waste-Less Food Fest to give people handy tips on reducing the amount of food they throw away, properly recycling food that can't be used and eating more sustainably.

On Sunday 20 October 2019 from 11-4pm at Richmond Library Annexe in Richmond, the Waste-Less Food Fest will include insightful talks and workshops, including; cooking demonstrations with chef Ann Storr; food sharing hints and tips from innovative company Olio, and using left overs for good causes with The Felix Project.

Richmond upon Thames is one of twelve London boroughs taking part in the Small Change, Big Difference campaign (14-20 October), which aims to help Londoners make a big difference to their health, pockets and the planet by getting savvier with their food.

The campaign is about eating more healthily and sustainably, reducing the amount of food wasted at home and recycling more of the inedible bits. This week is a celebration of the work that Londoners have done over the last two years as part of the campaign.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Leader Member for Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport for Richmond Council, said:

> "Over13% of what we throw away is food waste. Londoners throw away almost 910,000 tonnes of food each year. We must all more conscious about the food we are buying and wasting.  We want to help our residents save money and live more sustainable lives by reducing and recycling food waste and at our Waste-Less Food Fest we will be providing tips showing just how making one or two small changes can make a big difference."

Ali Moore, from the Small Change, Big Difference campaign, added:

> "By concentrating on small changes, such as freezing your bread or recycling banana skins, we can make a big difference - one recycled banana peel could generate enough electricity to fully charge your mobile phone twice! We're looking forward to all of Richmond upon Thames activities and are excited to have the borough take part."

Londoners are spending a whopping &pound;1.4 billion each year on buying food, with councils paying around &pound;50 million to dispose of it when it becomes waste. Not only is this waste environmentally damaging, but families could save up to &pound;70 a month by slightly changing the way we shop, prepare, store and eat our food. We can also do our bit to help with climate change by reducing our food waste and changing the way we dispose of our food.*

Here are some tips from Small Change, Big Difference for how to prevent food waste, eat more healthily and recycle the inedible bits:

- Freeze half your loaf if you don't always use it all. Pop the slices into your toaster straight from the freezer.
- Once you have opened your bagged lettuce - place it in a tub with kitchen roll to make it last longer.
- Eat from your freezer one day a week.
- Try canned veg in your cooking - it's packed with vitamins and lasts longer.
- Did you know you can freeze eggs? Simply crack them into a bowl and either separate or whisk together.
- Take a 'shelfie' of your fridge before shopping to avoid doubling up on items.
- One recycled banana peel could generate enough electricity to fully charge a mobile phone twice.
- Any container can act as a caddy in your kitchen, so long as you put the food waste you collect in the correct council box or bin outside your property.
- Did you know you can recycle, bones, eggshells, fruit peelings and coffee grounds in your council food waste collection?
- Make healthy ice cream using frozen banana - simply freeze, slice and blend.

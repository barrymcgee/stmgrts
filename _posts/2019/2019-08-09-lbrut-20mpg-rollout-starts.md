Roads in Richmond upon Thames are about to become safer for all our roads users with the phased roll-out of a borough-wide 20mph speed limit beginning on 5 August with the area around Kew Green and part of Hampton.

Following a consultation last year, which had 10,000 responses, it was agreed a 20mph limit would be implemented across the borough excluding TfL red routes, as well as parts of the A305, A308 and A310.

To make the implementation of the scheme as simple as possible, the borough has been split into 25 areas which follow natural boundaries like the river, railway, excluded roads and the borough's borders. The 20mph speed limit will go live in one area at a time.

Residents will notice changes to signage as the 20mph scheme rolls-out in their area. The Council will be taking the opportunity to declutter existing signage, such as entry plates for CPZs. Information on the go-live dates for each area will be available on Richmond Council's website.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of Richmond Council's Transport and Air Quality Committee said:

> "I am delighted that, starting today, we will be delivering on our promise to make the borough's roads a safer place for all road users.

> Following extensive public engagement in 2018 we have gone away, looked at feedback and are implementing a policy which takes into consideration what our residents want.

> Whilst the scheme is being implemented we will also be conducting further research and evaluation on those excluded roads to assess whether a 20mph would work in these areas.

> The roll-out will begin in Kew, whose residents were the most vocal supporters of the policy and will progress in zones over the next twelve months. I urge drivers to be aware of the new policy and remember to follow the new limit."

An accessible, interactive nature trail in Crane Park has now opened, thanks to two grants from Richmond Council.

The London Wildlife Trust was awarded &pound;3,870 through the Council's Civic Pride Fund and &pound;4,228 from The Community Fund to help make the Crane Park Island Trail more accessible to children and those with disabilities.

With the help of the Council, the Trust installed numbered oak posts each fitted with etched zinc plaque that depicts the varied wildlife and history of Crane Park Island. Children and adults can use the plaques to create rubbings. There is also a colourful and informative site map, and a quiz for families to take when visiting.

The trail was launched this week at the Shot Tower in Crane Park.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> Making the nature trail accessible for children and those with disabilities will allow more people to be able to enjoy the wonderful nature reserve on Crane Park Island. It further enables families to get outdoors, be active and learn about their environment at the same time and I am glad we have been able to support the project's development."

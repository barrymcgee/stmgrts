A project which aims to ensure no young woman misses out on her education because of her period has been set up in Richmond upon Thames

The Red Box Project is a nationwide initiative which is trying to eradicate period poverty.

According to Plan UK, one in ten girls in the UK have been unable to afford sanitary wear.

Almost half of UK girls have missed an entire day of school because of their period, of which 59 per cent have made up a lie or excuse.

The Red Box Project is entirely community driven and run by individuals across the UK.

Richmond Council has set up a donation box in the Civic Centre and plans to roll out boxes in other locations across the borough. Residents and staff are asked to donate new packets of tampons, sanitary pads and press-on towels.

The Red Box Project will then distribute the donations to schools around the borough for girls to access when they need.

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> "No woman should be held back because of her period. For a girl who doesn't have access to these sort of products, having the donation box can make a massive change to their lives. This vital service means that young women don't have to go home in an emergency and can easily access products free from embarrassment. I hope this goes a long way to overcoming any stigmas people may have. We all need to work together to tackle the issue of period poverty."

Donations can be left at the Civic Centre reception in Twickenham during opening hours, Monday to Friday from 9am till 5pm.

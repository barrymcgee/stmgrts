These are the last week of Turner's House's FIRST exhibition "Miniature Lands of Myth and Memory" since the house opened post conservation so, if you haven't had a chance to see Turner's illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's poetry and prose, do come along.

Combining Turner's exquisite designs and Scott's powerfully evocative text, Miniature Lands of Myth and Memory will take the visitor on a time-travelling journey through the north of England, the contested Border country between England and Scotland and the wild Western Highlands. Visitors are invited to follow a trail of landscapes, antiquities, folk tales and ballads that inspired Scott's poetry, before turning to recent history, the warmer climes of France and Italy and the battle fields of Napoleonic Europe.

Turner and Scott first collaborated in 1818 on the Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland, while Turner was still living at his Twickenham villa, Sandycombe Lodge. This exhibition, the first ever to be staged at Turner's newly-restored home, focusses on their last collaboration before Sir Walter's death in 1832; the illustrations to his Poetical Works and Turner's next commission, the designs for the Life of Napoleon Buonaparte.

Admission to the exhibition is included in the standard entrance fee and also comes with a full colour, 22 page exhibition catalogue.

*Exhibition closes Sun 22 September 2019*

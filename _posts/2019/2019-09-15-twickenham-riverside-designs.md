Residents and businesses can "have their say on five potential designs":https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/richmondce/twickenham-riverside/ for Twickenham Riverside, each created by a different architect led teams.

In March, Richmond Council launched a Design Competition to find an architect led team to work on proposals for the Twickenham Riverside site. The competition is managed by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).

The RIBA has extensive experience and is a widely recognised provider of architectural competitions, delivering high quality selection processes for both private and public-sector clients. They were commissioned to support the Design Panel to develop a new brief for the site and deliver a competition which is in line with procurement law and best practice. An impressive 54 architect firms subsequently applied and the Design Panel shortlisted five architects to move forward to the next stage.

Between Wednesday 4 September and Wednesday 2 October people can have their say online and can also attend a drop-in session on the below dates. Feedback will help members of the Design Panel understand the views of the community.

Drop-in exhibitions are being held on the below dates in the Clarendon Hall, York House, Twickenham TW1 3AA:

- Saturday 21 September from 10am to 5pm
- Tuesday 24 September from 6 to 8.30pm

The design competition is following official RIBA best practice and complying with relevant procurement law. This means that the final decision on the chosen design will be made in line with these rules, with the Design Panel scoring against an evaluation criteria which will consider different factors including how well the designs respond to the design brief and the financial viability of the designs.

It is important to note that this is not a vote on the five designs. Feedback from the public will be made available to the Design Panel during their deliberations.

The chosen architect will be announced in December.

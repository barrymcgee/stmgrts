Works by artist JMW Turner could be set for a return to his old home at Sandycombe Lodge with help from Richmond Council's Civic Pride Fund.

Turner's House Trust has been awarded a &pound;5,000 grant to help with security improvements at the house, so it can exhibit loaned Turner works. It is hoped bringing the works to Twickenham will encourage more visitors to the home.

The Council's Civic Pride Fund is available to individuals or groups who want to organise a project or event to improve their local area and deliver more for their local communities. Grants of up to &pound;5,000 are available to organisations and &pound;1,000 for individuals.

The grant comes ahead of the launch of the new &pound;20 note featuring Turner in 2020.

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council's spokesperson for Culture said:

> "The connection this borough has with JMW Turner is something to be celebrated, it's an iconic part of our artistic heritage. I am therefore delighted the Council has been able to support this project and I look forward to seeing some of his works on display in Turner's House in the very near future."

Ricky Pound, House Director said:

> "Turner's House Trust is thrilled to accept this Civic Pride Award from Richmond Council. Thanks to their generous support we will be able to receive loans from major institutions in the future and can now plan exhibitions of J.M.W. Turner's work to be displayed in the house he designed for himself in Twickenham."

Environment Trust, an environment and heritage charity based in South West London, is calling on artists to donate works of art to be sold at their fourth [Secret Art Sale in September](https://www.environmenttrust.org/Event/secret-art-sale-2019), to raise money for the charity's nature and heritage conservation work. The Secret Art Sale will be open from 11am - 6pm on Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> September and 11am to 5pm on Sunday 29<sup>th</sup> September.

Last year, Environment Trust raised &pound;16,000 from the art donated by Tracey Emin CBE RA, Axel Scheffler, James Butler MBE RA, Peter Randall-Page RA, Prof Norman Ackroyd CBE RA, Helen Baxendale, Julian Clary, Deborah Meaden, David Harsent, Rob and Nick Carter and many other artists.

In total, 429 works went on sale, all donated by a wide range of people including Royal Academicians, art students, as well as local artists, actors and personalities. Every penny of the profits went to improving and protecting the local environment and heritage in South West London.

Axel Scheffler, the best-selling illustrator of many favourite children's picture books, including the award-winning The Gruffalo is one of the charity's patrons and donates an illustration every year.

Axel says;

> "The Secret Sale is a unique way to raise funds for the important work that Environment Trust does. I'm delighted to take part again this year and I encourage other local artists to contribute a piece of art for this great cause."

Gill Smith, an artist and printmaker based in South West London, and a regular supporter, says;

> "The Secret Art Sale is a fantastic event that showcases a wide variety of different art works from anonymous artists. I live in South West London and Environment Trust is a wonderful local charity that I can support by donating my art. I look forward to working on this year's piece and attending the sale."

Environment Trust is looking for art that is A5 in size. The art can be a painting, drawing, sketch or photograph. Those who contribute can have their details and biography promoted on Environment Trust's web site and they will be invited with a friend to a special party for artists and VIPs on the evening of 28<sup>th</sup> September.

The works will be exhibited anonymously, and each will be sold at a price of &pound;40. This enables buyers to purchase works of art they like at an affordable price, whilst offering them the chance of owning work by a renowned artist or celebrity. Only when buyers purchase their art will the name of the artist be revealed.

Berny Simcox, CEO of Environment Trust says, "This is our main fundraising event each year and we hope even more artists will contribute to make this our biggest and best Secret Art Sale yet. We are a small charity, but we have big ambitions, and this is a great way for local artists, famous or not, to make a difference and support our conservation work."

The Secret Art sale takes place from 11am on Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> September to 5pm on Sunday 29<sup>th</sup> September at The Exchange in Twickenham. 75 London Road, Twickenham, TW1 1BE.

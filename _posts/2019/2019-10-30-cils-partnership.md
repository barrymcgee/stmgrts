A new borough-wide service to help adults of all ages live healthy lives, remain independent in their own homes and stay connected in their communities has been launched by Richmond Council.

The Community Independent Living Service (CILS) Partnership is made up of 20 local voluntary sector organisations. The service provides a free borough-wide network of support, information and advice. The newly redesigned service will operate across the borough from 1 November 2019, in place of the previous arrangements, and has two main components:

Advice, information and support on a range of topics including housing, benefits and finances, transport, health and social care, wellbeing and leisure will be provided by the Information Navigation service at Richmond AID, as well as supporting people to access relevant services within the partnership and the wider community.

Age UK Richmond will be leading the Health & Wellbeing partnership, which provides a range of wellbeing, social and practical support opportunities. This includes social and wellbeing centres for older people; activities; companionship; peer support for people with mental health issues; employment support for people with disabilities; volunteering opportunities; transport for people with limited mobility and integrated therapy for those with neurological conditions.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing Committee, said:

> "Making sure people can remain healthy, happy and in their own homes is a priority for this Council. We always aim to put our most vulnerable residents first. This is why we have worked with the voluntary sector to redesign our Community Independent Living Service.

> "This new partnership will deliver local, flexible, reliable and relevant services to all vulnerable residents across the borough - providing a well-used and invaluable life line for many people."

Lucy Byrne, Chief Executive from Richmond AID, said:

> "The CILS Information Navigation service is a vital service which supports people to access advice and information on a range of areas and to find out about services. We support people to remain or regain independence and get connected to their community. We look forward to continuing to work with Age UK Richmond and partners to deliver services."

Gavin Shand, Deputy Chief Executive from Age UK Richmond, said:

> "We look forward to leading the CILS Health & Wellbeing service across the borough, and working closely with our 19 partner organisations. All our partners deliver invaluable services for the local community- this new partnership gives us an opportunity to enhance these further and work together for the benefit of residents."

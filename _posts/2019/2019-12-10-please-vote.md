excerpt: |
    The 2019 General Election is on 12 December 2020.  With competing agendas around Brexit and austerity, it is hard to know what will happen.  Closer to home, Vince Cable is stepping down, so there will be a new MP for Twickenham.  And Richmond Park was won by only 45 votes last election.  It could be close.

10,000 residents and businesses can now order full-fibre, ultra-fast broadband in Twickenham.

Openreach is investing billions of pounds in full-fibre infrastructure in the UK and work to connect Twickenham up to ultrafast broadband is part of Openreach's Fibre Cities project. Since work started, around 10,000 homes and businesses in the borough have been able to access speeds capable of up to 1Gbps, with others following in the next few months.

These are the first homes in the borough to have been 'switched on' as part of the phased initial roll-out, enabling thousands more homes to access the new technology.

Residents and businesses in Twickenham can use the Openreach 'Fibre Checker' and see if they are eligible for the faster 'Fibre to the Premise' connection. Those who are can order the connection through a choice of broadband providers. Residents not eligible can still access a number of other superfast connections, including Gfast (up to 330Mbps) or Fibre to the Cabinet (up to 80Mbps).

Cllr Robin Brown, Lead Member for Finance for Richmond Council, said:

> "We want our residents and businesses to be amongst the best connected in the country, with high speed, high quality broadband available for all. Later in the year we will be consulting on the Council's digital strategy for improving services and communications with Richmond residents.

> "Encouraging faster internet connection will be key. This faster broadband will enable residents to download a feature film in under 25 seconds, it is more future proof and reliable.  For businesses there are also benefits, including uploading, downloading and transferring large files, enabling vital new digital services like uninterrupted monitoring, video conferencing and streaming, as well as enabling things like greater flexible working for staff.

> "Whilst this upgrade is currently only for Twickenham residents, we will be lobbying Openreach to ensure that the rest of the borough receives the faster connection as soon as possible.

> "If you live in Twickenham, go online now and see if you are eligible."

Managing Director for Strategic Infrastructure Development for Openreach, Kim Mears said:

> "We're delighted that the first residents and businesses in Twickenham can now benefit from our future-proof, resilient full-fibre broadband.

> Twickenham already has great high-speed broadband, with more than 99.4% of premises able to connect to 24 mpbs and over*.  But full-fibre broadband will help create prosperity, spread opportunity and drive exciting new developments in sectors from small business to health and education."

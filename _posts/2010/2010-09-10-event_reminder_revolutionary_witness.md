    Revolutionary Witness, which I am directing, opens at Hampton Hill Playhouse on September 19th, running for seven performances. The extra good news is that it's quite a short show - two halves of about 45minutes each. The show comprises personal reflections by four minor figures in the French Revolution.

Revolutionary Witness, which I am directing, opens at Hampton Hill Playhouse on September 19th, running for seven performances. The extra good news is that it's quite a short show - two halves of about 45minutes each. The show comprises personal reflections by four minor figures in the French Revolution. Written by Peter Barnes, it has a wonderful vein of sardonic humour, laughter and pain running in parallel. Originally four TV monologues commissioned by BBC2, this is the only time the script has ever been presented in this format: a theatrical occasion not to be missed.

The performance takes place in the Coward Room, a 53 seat studio theatre, and as shows there tend to sell out very quickly, if you want to come, book early. I may not be able to help with a last minute plea. (Contact details are on the attached flyer.) The other thing to be aware of is that on the opening night, Sunday September 19th, the performance starts at 6.00 pm. Otherwise at 7.45.

Oh, yes. And latecomers will be shot.

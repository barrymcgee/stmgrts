The music line up is now confirmed with sets from funk band Groove Manoova, local lads The Groovy Boys, acoustic duo Rock The Line, X-Factor contestant Anelisa Von Tease and more.

The hugely popular dog show has some new categories for St Margarets four legged friends to get excited about, including St Margarets Got Talent and Child's BFF along with the traditional favourites like Sit and Stay. This year's dog show will start at the earlier time of 1.30pm, so don't be late!

The 5-a-side football tournament is back and taking [team registrations now - sign up by 1 July](http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/football.html).

There are loads of fantastic local businesses in the avenue of stalls, and for businesses or charities still keen to join the fun then the final few stall spaces are up for grabs - but be quick - [book a space](http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/book.html).

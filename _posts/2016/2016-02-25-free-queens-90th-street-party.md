*Council waives fee for Queen's birthday street parties*

Residents are being urged to celebrate the Queen's 90<sup>th</sup> Birthday this spring by holding a street party.

The Queen turns 90 on April 21 this year and national commemorations will centre on her official birthday weekend in June (11/12).

As was the case with the 2011 royal wedding and then the Diamond Jubilee, the Council has stripped away all the bureaucracy and red tape of holding street parties around the borough. And, to celebrate the Monarch's 90<sup>th</sup> birthday, the Â£59 application fee will be waived for parties on the 11/12 June or 18/19 June.

Since the Council simplified its rules for street party applications, hundreds of residents have taken the opportunity to apply. Residents can apply online - remembering that all applications have to be submitted six weeks in advance of the party.

The Council asks that anyone organising a birthday street party to complete the forms as soon as possible. This is to allow enough time for them to be processed and signs to be produced and collected.

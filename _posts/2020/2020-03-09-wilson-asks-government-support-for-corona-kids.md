Following a visit to the Shooting star Children's Hospice in Hampton, Munira Wilson MP highlighted a gap in government contingency planning for coronavirus for children with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses.

In a letter sent today to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Munira raised questions around the "resilience of the social care workforce" in the face of expected measures such as widespread self-isolation.  At present, there are over 122,000 vacancies in the sector, with an estimated 8 million unpaid carers in the UK.

Munira Wilson, MP for Twickenham and Liberal Democrat Health Spokesperson, said:

> "Shooting Star Hospice in Hampton offers amazing care for children with life-limiting conditions, as well as support for their families, who often also provide extensive unpaid care.

> "I am deeply concerned what will happen to vulnerable children with serious illnesses who require round-the-clock care in the event of widespread self-isolation.  What plans are in place if care workers cannot get to work?  What support will be provided to unpaid carers who cannot grocery-shop, collect medication or even be in the same room as the children for whom they are caring?

> "The situation locally points to a potential problem facing the country at large. The government has so far done a good job keeping the public informed, but we need assurances for children who face significant challenges daily and their anxious families."

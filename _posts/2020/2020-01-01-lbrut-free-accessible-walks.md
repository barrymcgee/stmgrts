A programme of accessible walks has been launched by Richmond Council to encourage people of all abilities, particularly those with wheelchairs and walking aids, to get out and about and enjoy the beauty of the borough, whilst staying fit and healthy.

Richmond Accessible Wellbeing Walks is one of a range of free healthy lifestyles services on offer for local residents as part of the Friendly Parks for All project and is run in partnership with Richmond Ruils and Richmond Health Walks.

Monthly walks are short and over easy terrain. They are open to everyone but are especially aimed at those with limited mobility or walking aids. They are also suitable for people in wheelchairs, those who use walking aids, families with pushchairs, or people who simply prefer to walk on a flatter use surface.

The accessible walks are supported by a team of friendly, specially trained volunteers, including colleagues from local charity Ruils and Richmond Health Walks, who are on hand to provide encouragement and support, and make sure no one gets left behind.

Many walkers start walking to improve their health but find it easy to keep coming back because of all the new friends they've made. As well as all the physical health benefits, Walking for Health is also great for your social life!

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing Committee for Richmond Council, said:

> "Being physically active is proven to be good for physical and mental health. Simply spending a day outside is good for you and having a group to go with can help to reduce issues like social isolation. We want more people to enjoy a longer life in good health. The Healthy Walks programme is a great way to stay healthy and meet people."

Future walks are:

- 3<sup>rd</sup> February
- 2<sup>nd</sup> March
- 6<sup>th</sup> April
- 4<sup>th</sup> May

Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham is set reopen next week (21 July 2020), following the coronavirus closures, with measures in place to ensure the safety of all staff and visitors.

The popular riverside gallery has been closed for four months after having to shut its doors on Thursday 19 March.

In accordance with government guidance, measures are being put in place to ensure visitors are able to enjoy visits to the gallery once again.  Whilst there will be restrictions on the number of visitors allowed entry at any one time, a one-way system will also be in operation along with directional and distancing signs and sneeze screens located at customer service points.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Arts and Culture for Richmond Council, said:

> "Although we're eager to return and can't wait to welcome people back to Orleans House Gallery, before we reopen we need to put safeguards in place. The health and safety of our visitors, staff, and volunteers remain our priority.  We're working on this process now and following government guidelines to ensure our visitors, staff and volunteers can be safe when we re-open.

> "We have an exciting programme of exhibitions planned for the next few months and I am sure that everyone who visits the gallery will enjoy the experience."

Orleans House Gallery is a free public art gallery in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, managed by Richmond Council.

It includes the Grade 1 listed Octagon Room and is home to the Richmond Borough Art Collection.

Two galleries offer a varied programme of historic and contemporary exhibitions, and the Study Gallery explores the history of the local area.

Highlights at the Gallery this summer include:

- **Beyond the Frame** will reopen in the Main Gallery, showing new work from eighteen artists. Taking inspiration from the Richmond Borough Art Collection, they invite you to peer beyond the frame, peek beneath the canvas and step behind the brush.
- Robin MacFarlan's **Views from a Playroom** will reopen in the Stables Gallery. In scenes that are both natural and ludicrous, toys that were once our playthings now play with us, as they quietly mock the behaviour of the adults we have since become.
- Upcoming this autumn... artist collective **Alice in Hackneyland** will take over the Main Gallery with Trompe-l'&#339;il and a fluorescent banquet to celebrate the 300<sup>th</sup> birthday of the Octagon Room.
- Upcoming this autumn... **Art Unlocked** is a response to the unfurling of Covid-19 by the artists, designers and makers of Richmond Art House Open Studios.

The Gallery will reopen on the 21<sup>st</sup> July 2020. Opening hours and days are: Tuesday to Sunday 10am to 5pm.

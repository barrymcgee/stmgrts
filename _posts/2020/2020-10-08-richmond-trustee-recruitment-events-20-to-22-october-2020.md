If you're thinking of taking on a new volunteering role, a trustee position could be for you and the Richmond Trustee Recruitment Evenings could be just the online meeting to inspire your next steps.

This year's event will be held online, across two themed evening sessions - you can join one or both. Small charities have been at the heart of the local Covid response in recent months and have never been more needed. Your support, as part of a trustee board, could play a vital part in their continued survival, success and development.

Every charity or not-for-profit group is unique and will look for individuals with a range of interests, experience and skills, along with a genuine passion for their work. Trustee roles are usually strategic, rather than practical, and can fit around your regular commitments. If you're in employment, your workplace may have an Employer Support Volunteering scheme, to help you find the time to support a cause close to your heart.

Whether you've just started considering this specialist type of volunteering or are seeking a new trustee role, you're welcome to join the event. It's free to register and anyone aged over 18 years is invited!

As 2019 comes to a close, we wanted to share some quick stats on the year that has gone by, as we have in [2018](/archives/2019/01/st_margarets_community_website_2018_review.html), [2017](/archives/2017/12/st_margarets_community_website_2017_review.html), [2016](/archives/2016/12/st_margarets_community_website_2016_review.html), [2015](/archives/2015/12/st_margarets_community_website_2015_review.html) and [2014](/archives/2014/12/st_margarets_community_website_2014_review.html). The site has gone through many big changes this year, but not many people will notice, including:

- Updated the pages based on a csswizardry workshop's recommendations to improve site speed
- Started using Cloudinary for index page images and a new Suru design

#### Usage stats

These are up a bit from last year, mostly down to the very long tail of many of Martyn Day's articles:

|                   |    2019 |    2018 |    2017 |    2016 |
| ----------------- | -------:| -------:| -------:| -------:|
| Sessions          | 119,875 | 110,629 |  63,915 |  63,903 |
| Users             |  99,007 |  88,377 |  48,410 |  47,013 |

### How people accessed the site

<a href="/assets/images/2020/chart-2019-access-stats.svg" title="Click for a larger image"><img src="/assets/images/2020/chart-2019-access-stats.svg"
width="400" alt="Image - chart-2019-access-stats"  class="center"/></a>

One trend we have been watching is how many people are now using the site on phones and tablets. This is why we continue making the site work better on smaller screens.  This year's mobile usage as soared to well over half of all sessions!

| Device  | Sessions | Change&nbsp;from&nbsp;2018 |
|:------- | --------:| --------------------------:|
| Desktop |   39.54% |                     10.74% |
| Mobile  |   50.16% |                      -7.8% |
| Tablet  |    10.3% |                     -2.94% |

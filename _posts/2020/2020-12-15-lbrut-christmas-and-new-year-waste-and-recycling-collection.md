For more information or to order more recycling boxes call 020 8891 1411, email  [wasteandrecycling@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:wasteandrecycling@richmond.gov.uk) or visit [www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling)

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, if residents are self-isolating and feeling ill they should continue to put any potentially infected items (like used tissues or cleaning cloths) into separate plastic bags and double-bag them. These bags should be stored for 72 hours before being put in with general waste for collection.

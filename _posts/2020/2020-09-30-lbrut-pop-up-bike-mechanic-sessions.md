Free 'Dr Bike' servicing session will be returning next month to Richmond Green.

As more and more residents are taking up cycling, it is important that riders check their bike regularly, so that they are working properly and are safe to ride.

West London Waste are hosting a socially-distanced Dr Bike session during Repair Week on the 14 October from 11-3pm on Richmond Green.

At Dr Bike sessions experienced mechanics check everything on your bike from wheels, brakes, gears and tyre pressure to lights, racks, pedals, saddles and more.

Any minor adjustments they can make to the bike they do there and then. Anything they can't fix on site they will let cyclists know exactly what needs doing and a rough guide to what it should cost at a bike shop.

To ensure social distancing, anyone wanting to bring along their bike will need to book in advance, hand sanitiser will be provided and all those who attend are asked to wear a face covering.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> "Whether your dusting off an old bike from the shed or are a regular cyclist. It's important that your bike is safe and roadworthy. It doesn't take long for a bike safety check to take place and best of all, it's free.

> "Dr Bike will see you now - Richmond upon Thames!"

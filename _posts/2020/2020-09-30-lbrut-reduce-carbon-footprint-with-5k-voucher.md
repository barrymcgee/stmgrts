Richmond Council is urging residents to take steps towards reducing the carbon footprint of their property by applying for a Green Homes Grant voucher.

The Government scheme provides a voucher to cover up to two thirds of the cost of energy efficiency, such as insulating your home to reduce your energy use or installing low-carbon heating to lower the amount of carbon dioxide your home produces. Vouchers have a maximum value of &pound;5000.

To apply for the voucher, residents must either own their home or be a private or social landlord.

Residents who are on a low income and receive certain benefits can receive a voucher covering all of the cost of the improvements, to a maximum value of &pound;10,000.

Councillor Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sports Committee, said:

> "One of the six themes of our Climate Emergency Strategy is "Our Legacy" - this is about ensuring that the built environment in our borough is sustainable. While the Council makes improvements to its own properties, it is also important that we support and encourage residents to reduce their carbon emissions too.

> "The Green Homes Grant vouchers are a great way to get started and Richmond home-owners and landlords should consider applying, especially as we head into winter. It is important that we heat our homes in an efficient way - and improvements through the Grant could potentially save up to &pound;600 a year in energy bills."

The Government has set out primary and secondary measures - vouchers must be used to install at least one primary measure. Residents can then choose to make secondary improvements if they wish.

Primary measures include multiple types of insulation and low-carbon heat sources, such as heat pumps, solar thermal and biomass boilers. Secondary measures include window and door glazing, draught proofing and installation of heating controls such as smart heating and intelligent thermostats.

Residents can learn more about the Grant and the approved measures, and check if they are eligible to apply, online at [www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme](http://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme).

New-build properties that have not previously been occupied are not eligible for the scheme. Work must be scheduled to be completed and the voucher redeemed by 31 March 2021.

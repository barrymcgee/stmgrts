Both mindfulness and therapeutic yoga are well known to help reduce stress, anxiety and depression, this 8-week yoga therapy course will help you access these profound healing properties.

Developed by The Minded Institute this course combines specific yoga therapy techniques and mindfulness with research from the fields of psychotherapy and neuroscience. It aims to:

- Provide self-regulation techniques to better manage stress, anxiety and depression on a day to day basis
- Enhance the functioning of the nervous system to improve well-being
- Improve self-awareness through the practice of mindfulness
- Promote the elimination of negative habitual patterns of thought and behaviour.

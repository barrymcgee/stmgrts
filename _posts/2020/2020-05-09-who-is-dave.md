A week or two ago a highway engineer visited our little corner of paradise and using a white paint spray started decorating the streets with obscure hieroglyphics. From above they look like a miniature version of the ancient, mysterious - and huge - Nazca geoglyphs in Peru which represent amongst other things a hummingbird, a spider and a monkey. Because the Nazca lines, laid out about 2,000 years ago, can only be fully appreciated from a great height some people say that they were constructed either by or for extra-terrestrials!

I do not think that the lines in our streets were created by aliens although one cannot be too sure. Anthropologists, ethnologists, and archaeologists reckon that the Nazca lines have a religious significance but Is this the case in north St Margarets? Our local lines snake around areas that clearly needed resurfacing. There are many arrows with bars pointing along kerbstones, particularly on corners. There are big crosses over manholes and drain covers and odd numbers and letters scattered in apparently random patterns. Strangest of all, on a couple of street corners, a repeated message appears...

DAVE
MEASURE
PATCH
SEPERATLEY

But what does it all mean?

1. Is the unusual spelling of *'Seperatley'* a clue to a coded message?
2. Are the hieroglyphs intended for aliens?
3. Could the good folk of the Highways Department be extra-terrestrials themselves?
4. Where is the "Patch"... and more importantly...

Are you an EU citizen living, working or studying in Richmond upon Thames and worried about Brexit? Why not attend a free event to find out about your rights!

The virtual event will be held on the 3<sup>rd</sup> November at 2pm. It will be opened by Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council. Attendees will be able to find out more about their rights as EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, including their rights to work, claim benefits, access public housing and receive NHS treatment.

The event will also briefly cover the Settled Status scheme and how to apply for British nationality.

The event is delivered by Citizens Advice Richmond as part of a package of support, funded by the Council, aimed at enabling EU residents to get impartial, expert advice on nationality matters or the impact of the Government's proposals and options available for them.

Although the event is free you do need to register to attend. You can also sign up for e-updates from Citizens Advice Richmond.

Leader of Richmond Council, Cllr Gareth Roberts, said:

> "Many of our friends and neighbours may have been born outside of Richmond upon Thames, but they've put down roots and helped to make this a great place for families. We want them to continue to contribute, and we are doing all we can to support our residents who are EU nationals to understand what they need to do in order to stay living here with their families."

In addition, EU nationals based in the borough are reminded that the deadline to apply for the European Union Settlement Scheme (EUSS) is 30 June 2021. Whilst thousands of local people have already applied, we are aware that many people who are eligible are yet to submit an application.

The Council is urging all residents from EU countries and eligible non-EEA nationals who want to stay in the UK to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme as soon as possible.

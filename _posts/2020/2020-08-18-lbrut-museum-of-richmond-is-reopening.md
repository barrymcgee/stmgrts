The Museum is delighted to announce that it is once again open to visitors. The Museum team have been working hard to ensure all COVID-19 safety measures are in place.

The Museum is providing access by free timed entry tickets which can be booked online for a household of up to 8 people.

Booking a ticket means having the Museum to yourself and your household, giving you the opportunity to explore Richmond's great history through the Museums marvellous collection.

Enjoy the exciting exhibition: Queen's Road: 500 Years of History, which has extended its run until January 2021.

Once a muddy track through the Richmond countryside, Queen's Road is unrecognisable today. Discover the fascinating history of this road, including farmland owned by Tudor courtiers, a pest house for plague sufferers, grand Victorian developments and innovative social housing.

The exhibition has been supported by a number of generous individuals, as well as Civic Pride Fund and Richmond Parish Land Charity.

The Museum team very much look forward to welcoming you.

Sports centres and swimming pools across the borough will start to re-open in phases, with reduced capacity, from next month. Those wanting to use the facilities will now have to book a timed session in advance.

Over the past few weeks, the Council has been working hard to make sure that all Council-run sports centres and swimming pools are safe and have measures in place that are in line with Government and industry guidance, to limit the spread of Coronavirus.

Some of the operational changes required include a significant restriction on the number of participants and users of facilities, hence why an advanced booking arrangement is required.  To ensure measures are as robust and safe as they can be, centres will be re-opened on a phased basis. As a number of the centres are based on school sites, some of these facilities will not be able to fully re-open until the Autumn.

Schedule for reopening:

- 3<sup>rd</sup> August
    - Outdoor Pool - Pools on the Park

Cllr J-F Burford, Sports Champion, said:

> "Sports centres across the country have been closed for four months to help stop the spread of the coronavirus and although necessary, this has come at a great cost to our physical and mental health. We are so pleased that people can now take part in a range of activities that boost health and wellbeing and whilst we can't go back to the way things were just yet, we'll do everything we can to ensure that you have a safe and enjoyable visit.

> "We'll look at what we have in place every week and increase services wherever we can, but our main priority as we reopen is to keep our customers and staff safe. We've been in touch with bodies like UK Active, Swim England and UK Athletics to ensure that our plans are based on the very latest advice and we'll put everything you need to know on our website, so please check it before every visit to make sure you're prepared."

To ensure social distancing our facilities will have a significantly reduced capacity and all activity will be in timed sessions which ALL customers will be required to book onto in advance.

All centres have undergone a rigorous deep clean. Equipment in gyms have been moved to make it easier for customers to practise social distancing and signage has been installed throughout in order to remind customers of the current requirements.

New cleaning stations have been installed and customers are asked to clean equipment before and after use. There will be limited access to changing rooms and lockers for customers wishing to swim. The gym changing rooms, lockers and water fountains will not be in use. Customers will be asked to bring their own pre-filled water bottles.

The reception areas have been reworked to include Perspex dividers, in order to protect both staff and customers.

In order to ensure social distancing, time for increased cleaning, and to support Test and Trace, ALL customers will be required to book onto all activities in advance.

All current Feel Good Fitness memberships are on hold and no further payments will be taken. Members will be given advance written notice of any planned reactivation dates and this will include when the next direct debit will be taken (if on a monthly membership). The closure period will be added on to existing annual membership.

As part of our phased reopening, existing members are able to temporarily book and pay for admission on a Pay As You Go basis. We hope this option allows the comfort and flexibility to book on to a session whilst we all learn to live with Covid-19.

Bookings can be made via the LBRUT app, online at [www.richmond.gov.uk/sports](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/sports )and by phone on 020 3772 2999.

Like many other Arts Communities, we have been unable to open our doors and we have very much missed the warmth, the friendship, the buzz - and the sales - of our Open Studios.

This does not mean that we have been idle. In fact, many of us have been experimenting with materials, learning new d techniques, started new projects either working from home or coming to the studios in single numbers!

The results of all this "behind the scenes" work has been collected under our individual discipline and name in this online shop and we hope you will find it interesting, inspiring and covet-able. Please enter our "Christmas Shop"  and if you find something special to gift or buy for yourself, contact the artist, who will arrange for collection or delivery.

We do hope that we will be able to have normal Open Studios again soon, but in the meantime be safe and enjoy your Christmas Festivities!

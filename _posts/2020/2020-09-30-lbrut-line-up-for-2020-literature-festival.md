In a year when books have never been more important, find out what's going on throughout November for this year's Literature Festival.

The programme includes talks by authors, historians, politicians, poets and more, with writing workshops, as well as activities for children and families.

Programme highlights include:

- Sir Vince Cable on his new book China: the new Cold (and Hot?) War
- Kaiya Stone on her book Everything is Going to be K.O. - a humorous and witty account of her experience of dyslexia and dyspraxia
- A conversation with Kate Fall, the Deputy Chief of Staff for David Cameron from 2010-2016 and author of The Gatekeeper
- A conversation with the queen of vintage-inspired homeware, Cath Kidston
- An online event with Booker-Prize winning author Ben Okri
- A conversation with football novel author Dan Freedman whose popular series of Jamie Johnson books were adapted for the CBBC and became the most downloaded children's show on BBC iPlayer

The full programme of events can be found at [www.richmondliterature.com](http://www.richmondliterature.com)

Richmond Literature Festival venues are working hard to ensure the safety of visitors and staff. To comply with COVID-19 venue guidelines, less tickets will be on sale this year and a digital programme is available for those who are shielding. Please note that arrangements are subject to change with government COVID-19 guidance and the programme may become fully digital if the need arises. For a list of measures taken, click here.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Culture for Richmond Council, said:

> "We are thrilled that #RichLitFest is back for its 29<sup>th</sup> year. Festivals like these are important during stressful times and I hope local people enjoy the incredible line-up on inspiring events from some of the very best writers and speakers going!

> "It's an eclectic line-up with something for everyone."

The Box Office opens 6 October 2020 and you can [book online](http://www.richmondliterature.com/how-to-book.html) or by phone.

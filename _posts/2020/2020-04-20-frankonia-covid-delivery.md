Frankonia The Breadhouse are an artisan bakery who normally serve wholesale customers and members of the public who buy directly from our bakery. Due to the current covid-19 lockdown conditions we have opened a shop at the bakery selling breads, pastries, muffins, fruit and veg boxes plus some other treats.

We have also introduced an online home delivery service in our local area. This is to help people who are self-isolating, are vulnerable, or cannot make it along to the bakery shop at this time. We really want to help the community as much as we can to ensure that you can still get lovely breads and treats.

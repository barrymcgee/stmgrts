Richmond residents have the chance to win a Christmas hamper full of goodies from local retailers, as part of the Mayor of the Borough's Christmas fundraising efforts.

Five hampers are up for grabs, with raffle tickets costing just &pound;3. Hampers are worth around &pound;50 and will be filled items from a range of businesses from across the borough, including beer, wine, sweet treats and gifts.

All proceeds from the raffle will go to the Mayor's chosen charities, A Dose of Nature and Habitats & Heritage, both of which work to preserve and enhance the natural environment in the borough and connect people with nature and the green spaces around them.

Councillor Geoff Acton, Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, said:

> "I am delighted we are able to offer this Christmas raffle to raise money for my charities and give you a taste of some of the best our local businesses have to offer, as have already been showcased through our Shop Local campaign.

> "Charities and the high streets have faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am particularly proud of the work A Dose of Nature and Habitats & Heritage have done during this difficult time - nature has provided respite for many people and these charities do so much to support that. I hope as many people as possible will buy a ticket - or multiple tickets - to be in with a chance to win one of our hampers!"

Ticket sales close on Tuesday 15 December and winners will be announced on Friday 18 December. To find out more and buy a ticket visit [richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities](https://richmond.gov.uk/mayors_charities)

Men aged over 30 are encouraged to get active and join a weight-loss programme to get fit and healthy

A partnership between Public Health and Brentford FC Community Sports Trust is urging men aged 30 and over to join a new 12-week weight-loss programme beginning in September 2020.

Whilst much remains unclear about COVID-19, the risk increases if you're male, older, from a black or minority ethnic community, overweight, have diabetes or other underlying health conditions.

With this in mind, Public Health wants residents to take proactive steps to get fitter and healthier. The weight-loss programme is led by sport and exercise specialists and includes fitness exercises, healthy eating workshops and top tips for permanent lifestyle changes.

The classes and workshops will take place online via Zoom and cost just &pound;6.00 per week.

Get in touch with  [health@brentfordfccst.com](mailto:health@brentfordfccst.com) to find out more details and to secure your place.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services and Health Committee and the Health & Wellbeing Board, said:

> "By signing up to the programme, you will be part of a health and fitness community that will make starting your weight-loss journey straight forward and even enjoyable!"

Steve from Twickenham, who completed the programme last year, added:

> "After completing this programme, I feel a lot better being lighter and more agile, and I actually enjoy exercise now!

> "The best part of the programme was the other participants and the coaches; everyone helped everyone else and the coaches had good tips on a better diet and how to exercise."

The theatres may not be open for business, but Teddington Theatre Club is performing some of Oscar Wilde's greatest works for free during its "Wilde Weekend" on 27<sup>th</sup>& 28<sup>th</sup> June 2020.

Running non-stop from the afternoon of Saturday 27 June until the afternoon of Sunday 28<sup>th</sup> over 60 actors will take part in the reading of Oscar Wilde's rich canon of work which will include five of his best known plays including An Ideal Husband, Lady Windermere's Fan and The Importance of Being Earnest together with a selection of poems, letters and essays and his two unfinished plays, one of which has never been staged.

Lottie Walker, Artistic Director for Teddington Theatre Club said;

> "This is an ambitious endeavour and requires a huge team effort, but TTC has never shied away from a challenge!  There will be something for everyone and we really hope the local community get behind this and support what will be a weekend of first class entertainment."

TTC will run Wilde Weekend via Zoom, but be broadcast live to the general public on TTC's YouTube channel. Members will use their collective skills to act, direct and manage the Wilde Weekend and rehearsals are already underway.

Oscar Wilde belongs in the pantheon of the greatest writers ever to grace the English language. Last week marked 125 years since Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years hard labour for the simple crime of being gay.  Over the following two years, Wilde was imprisoned in three separate prisons, most notably Reading Gaol, which inspired his poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol which will be included in the schedule.

#### Landmark 25 Appeal

As part of TTC's own contribution to the Landmark 25 Appeal, The Wilde Weekend will consist of 25 hours of Oscar Wilde content and the full running schedule will be announced nearer the time.

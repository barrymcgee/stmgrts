Local charity, Embracing Age, is creating Christmas Gift Boxes for care home residents that do not have family or friends so that they feel valued and loved by their community at this difficult time.

If you would like to make a difference to a care home resident this Christmas, please consider donating a small gift. Suggested items include toiletries, puzzle books, colouring books and crayons, small games (e.g. dominoes, cards etc...), arts and craft items. Alternatively, you can donate to their online appeal and Embracing Age will buy gifts on your behalf. Donations can be accepted up to 17 December 2020.

Gifts can be left, unwrapped, in the marked crate outside the ETNA Community Centre every Tuesday and Thursday from 24 November - 17 December, between 9.30 - 12.30. For further information, or to donate online, please visit: [www.embracingage.org.uk/giftbox.html](https://www.embracingage.org.uk/giftbox.html)

Embracing Age will distribute the gift boxes to care home residents in the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames. Your donations will make a real difference to brightening a care home resident's Christmas at this challenging time.

Thank you.

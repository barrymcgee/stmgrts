Residents are reminded that the free Christmas tree recycling service will commence from Monday 4 January 2021.

From Monday 4 January through to Friday 15 January, Richmond Council will be collecting real Christmas trees, for free, on residents' scheduled waste collection days. Trees will then be shredded and turned into compost, which will be used to feed plants in gardens, green spaces and bedding plots across the borough.

Residents should remove all ornaments and stands or pots from their trees and leave them outside their property in a place that does not block the pavement, ideally next to recycling containers, on their collection day. Residents are also reminded not to pile up Christmas trees at the end of the road, blocking footpaths. This is fly-tipping and could be liable to enforcement action if witnessed (see the below image.)

Residents who live in a block of flats are asked to take their Christmas trees to one of the drop-off points (highlighted below). If this is not possible, we will collect trees left in communal waste areas.

Alternatively, you can take your Christmas tree to:

- Household Waste and Recycling Centre, Townmead Road, Kew, open throughout the festive period, except 25, 26 and 27 December 2020 and 1 January 2021. **[Please remember to book ahead](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/townmead_road).**
- Barn Elms Sports Centre, SW13 0DG (opposite Barnes Rugby Centre)
- Squire's Garden Centre Car Park, Sixth Cross Road, TW2 5PA
- Old Deer Car Park, TW9 2RA
- Ham Street Car Park, TW10 7RS
- Nelson Road Car Park, TW2 7BB
- Hampton Library Car Park, TW12 2AB
- North Lane Car Park, Teddington, TW11 0HJ

A new FREE career transition programme has been launched by Richmond Work Match to help those who have been made redundant or are at risk of losing their job as a result of Covid-19.

Richmond Council launched the local Work Match service in October. It aims to find jobs, apprenticeships and offers training for people in the borough. Over the past month, the service has already seen an increase in referrals as a result of the pandemic. With at least 9,800 local residents furloughed as a result of Covid19, many people are also at risk of redundancy.

In partnership with Richmond Hillcroft Adult Community College (RHACC), Richmond Work Match has developed a programme designed to offer employment support to ensure local people are in the best possible position to re-enter the job market when possible.

The free programme offers guidance on:

- Social media presence and personal brand
- Career coaching and job brokerage
- Access to sector led training
- An individual, tailored learning plan
- Support with career development

Cllr Richard Baker, Spokesperson for Economics and Business for Richmond Council, said:

> "As the borough gets back on its feet, many people may be finding that they need to find a new job or are worried about employment security in the future.

> "The expert team at Work Match, along with our partners at RHACC, will provide trusted advice and help with your CV, training or simply confidence-building so that you are ready for the right opportunity when it comes up. If you need help or advice - get in touch now."

Grit King, a recent Career Transition Programme participant from Twickenham, said:

> "I took part in this course not quite sure what to expect. I can honestly say now that I'm pleased I did. It's been absolutely amazing and has given me so many practical tips on my job search.

> "All three coaches were brilliant and I loved how interactive the course was. We also spent a lot of time going into depth about change, resilience, emotional intelligence and fulfilled tasks to practise these newly learnt skills. I'm very grateful for having had the opportunity to attend this course and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to or thinking about changing careers or just looking for a new job."

If you are at risk of redundancy or have been made recently redundant, Richmond Work Match are here to help.

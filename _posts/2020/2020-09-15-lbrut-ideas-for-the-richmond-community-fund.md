Richmond Council is about to the launch the next phase of the Community Fund. Residents or local groups with ideas on potential projects can attend a virtual information session to find out how their idea can be turned into a reality.

The Richmond Council Community Fund comes from the Community Infrastructure Levy. A tax paid by developers to help reduce any negative impact upon the community, a portion of the total tax collected will fund local priority projects.

The fund will launch on the 12<sup>th</sup> October and will close on 4<sup>th</sup> December. To help people understand the fund, submission criteria and for hints and tips on what makes a great application, two sessions are being held next month on Zoom.

- [Thursday 8<sup>th</sup> October from 10-12pm](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/london-borough-of-richmond-upon-thames-council-30473296262)
- [Monday 26<sup>th</sup> October from 5.30-7pm](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/richmond-upon-thames-community-fund-applicant-workshop-repeated-session-tickets-120367190507)

Cllr Michael Wilson, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Equalities, Communities and the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "The last few months have really shown us that residents have a strong vision for the future of their community. This fund will help make some of the community ideas and initiatives a reality.

> "I hope many more community organisations and local groups will get involved and work with Council officers and local ward councillors to bring forward strong project proposals for funding."

Previous projects that have been successful as part of the Community Fund range from a toy library scheme, new community caf&#233; and kitchen, restoration of a local church Hall, new electric vehicle for a local youth group and improvements on a local high street.

This money might be used for a variety of projects, including; green space improvements, resources and equipment for community use or community centre renovations.

Any local resident, business or community group, living or operating within the borough can bring forward a proposal which should be for more than &pound;5,000 and must meet certain criteria.

For more details on how to apply and the criteria contact your local Community Engagement Officer: [CommunityConversations@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:CommunityConversations@richmond.gov.uk) and visit the website: [www.richmond.gov.uk/community_fund](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_fund)

Ninety five percent of in-borough applicants have been offered a place at one of their first three preferred primary schools.

On 16 April, Richmond Council made the initial allocation of Reception class offers for this September. This year, the parents/carers of 2,232 children applied for a place - compared with 2,247 last year.

84% have been offered a place at their first preference primary school, compared to last year's figure of 85%. In addition, 97% have been offered one of their top three preferences (95% last year) and 98% have received one of their preferences (same as in 2019).

Currently there are no children without an offer of a primary school place.

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> "I am delighted that we have again been able to offer such a high number of parents a place at their first preference school.

> "Our schools are deservedly popular owing to the fact that they continue to top the league tables and offer excellent, inclusive education for local children.

> "I would like to thank our team at Achieving for Children who have worked so hard in coordinating this effort, particularly throughout the pandemic. It hasn't been easy.

> "I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all our schools for their work over the past few weeks. Particularly the way they have pulled together to make sure there are enough places for children who are vulnerable or children whose parents are key workers in the fight against Corona Virus. This has not been an easy time for schools and I know that there has been a huge amount of work that has gone into making sure that places and school meals are available."

Enforcement on all on-street parking will recommence on Monday 25<sup>th</sup> May.

Since the lockdown, the Council has prioritised enforcement against dangerous parking and relaxed day-to-day parking enforcement.

Free parking for NHS staff, carers and volunteers will still be in place.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Services Committee, said:

> "Following the Prime Ministers statement, we are expecting an increase in vehicle traffic across the borough. It is our responsibility to ensure that our roads don't descend into chaos; our roads need to be clear and those who need to park are able to park.

> "We are giving residents nearly a fortnight's notice. From next Monday (18th) we will start issuing warnings. However, from the 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020 all on-street parking charges will be enforced, as will unauthorised parking.

> "Please don't get caught out. Double check the rules online before you leave your home, but all rules are the same as before Covid."

To enable those who work in health services or deliver vital community support to more easily park and access people's homes the Council has suspended enforcement of its on-street and car park facilities for NHS and social care staff. This will continue for the immediate future. Please see the Council website for further information.

The Council will continue to provide parking enforcement of the serious incidents that could have a more significant impact on safety and traffic flow e.g. yellow lines at road junctions, the obstruction of dropped kerbs, footway parking that intrudes upon pedestrian access etc. However, the additional changes will be enforced over the next few weeks:

Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs)

Residents and businesses with permits in Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs) are still currently permitted to park on single yellow lines without penalty. Exceptions are where there are safety risks e.g. corners of junctions, across dropped kerbs and on double yellow lines. Residents or businesses without a permit or that hold a recently expired permit will need to apply/reapply for a dispensation or permit by Monday 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020.

Unauthorised parking

Civil Enforcement Officers will continue to grant a 20-minute grace period (increased from 5 minutes) for unauthorised parking (in all but demonstrably unsafe or obstructive instances) until Monday 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020.

Parking Charges

The Council will also renew enforcement all on-street parking charges (such as parking meters and pay and display machines) from Monday 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020.

In all cases, please do not park in locations where doing so could endanger fellow residents. If you are instructed to move your vehicle by an Enforcement Officer, please do so. If you do not, your vehicle may be moved. We will review these changes daily.

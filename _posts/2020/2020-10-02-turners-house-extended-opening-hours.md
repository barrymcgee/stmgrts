Turner's House in Twickenham have extended their opening hours so that more people can enjoy the artist's home and its widely acclaimed exhibition.

The house, lived in and designed by J.M.W. Turner had reopened in August on a reduced schedule from Thursdays to Saturday but will now extend this to include Wednesdays.

Sir David Attenborough opened their first exhibition of J.M.W. Turner's original work in January this year, which attracted widespread publicity and resulted in the exhibition selling out until the end of April, its original end date. But, thanks to Tate generously extending its loan, the exhibition of five oil sketches of the Thames can now be seen until October 31<sup>st</sup>.

Rigorous precautions have been taken to protect staff and visitors, including limiting the number of visitors in the house to just eight at any one time which provides an enhanced, more intimate experience.

> "Turner's House Trust are incredibly grateful to our volunteers for working these extra hours and to the Tate for this extension of their loan, the first Turner works to be shown in his house since 1826." Says Ricky Pound, House Director, "We've had great feedback since reopening, as limiting numbers has meant more space in the house for visitors to explore and this has been welcomed with enthusiasm!"

Turner and the Thames: Five Paintings, features rare oil sketches at Turner's House, Sandycombe Lodge, 40 Sandycoombe Road, St Margarets, Twickenham TW1 2LR. Due to the current Covid-19 situation, advance booking is essential. Visitors will receive a short introduction to the house in the garden and then enjoy a self-guided visit from Wednesday-Saturday: 12pm-1pm-2pm-3pm (last entrance). Exclusive guided tours for small family groups and close friends can also be arranged. Please contact  [housedirector@turnershouse.org](mailto:housedirector@turnershouse.org) for further details.

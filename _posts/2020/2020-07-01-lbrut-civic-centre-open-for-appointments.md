The Civic Centre in Twickenham will be partially reopening next week on an appointment basis only. This follows a public closure during lockdown.

On the 24 March, the Council's main public reception closed, inline with Government guidance around Covid19.

New guidance has now been issued about public buildings and over the past few weeks the Council has put in place measures to ensure the safety of all those in the building. This includes a rigorous deep cleaning programme and social distancing measures - including signage / hand sanitisers and sneeze screens.

As the country begins to slowly reopen, the Civic Centre will partially open for residents who are unable to access services online. Those who need face-to-face support will be able to make an appointment via the Council's Customer Services Team, enabling them to meet a Council officer to discuss:

- Parking Permits
- Council Tax
- Housing Benefits
- Housing needs
- Blue badge assessments
- Registrars (limited services as per government guidance)

Appointments will be staggered each day and residents will be asked to use an intercom when they arrive. Only those with an appointment will be able to come into the building.

Cllr Robin Brown, Lead Member for Finance for Richmond Council, said:

> "Similarly to all other local authorities, we closed our Civic Centre reception to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our staff but also residents.

> "Throughout lockdown, residents have been able to access nearly all our services online - paying bills, finding information, applying for grants or support. Our contact centre has also taken thousands of phone calls - continuing to offer similar support.

> "For those residents who can, we encourage them to continue to go online or pick up the phone. But for the small number of people who are not able to go online, we are now opening a limited appointments service.

> "If you do have an appointment, I can reassure you that we have made every effort to ensure that our buildings are safe. However, I do ask everyone to read the signs, use the hand sanitiser and respect social distancing - to ensure your safety and the safety of our staff."

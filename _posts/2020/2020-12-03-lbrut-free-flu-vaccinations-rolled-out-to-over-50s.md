People aged 50 to 64 can now receive a free flu vaccine as part of the expanded flu vaccination programme this winter.

This age group has been newly added to this year's national flu vaccination programme in response to the additional health risks associated with coronavirus. Catching flu and coronavirus at the same time could have serious consequences for your health and put our healthcare system under strain, so it is vital that as many people as possible eligible for the flu jab receive the flu vaccine.

Speak to your GP or pharmacist to book yours.

The other groups eligible for a free flu vaccine are:

- Adults aged 65 and over
- Those who have an underlying health condition (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease or chronic neurological disease)
- Pregnant women
- Children aged 2-3 years old
- All primary school children and those in year 7
- Household contacts of those on the NHS shielded patient list for Covid-19
- Those who are in receipt of a carer's allowance, or who are the main carer of an older or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if the carer falls ill
- Frontline health and social care workers

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health & Housing Committee and the Richmond Health & Wellbeing Board, said:

> "In the context of the pandemic, it's more important than ever that we take action to protect the NHS and health care resources for those who need them most this winter. The flu jab takes no time at all and will help stop you and your loved ones from getting a nasty illness this winter. So, even if you have never had a flu vaccine before, please play your part and get your flu jab!"

Take a trip down memory lane with speaker Ian Franklin and remember what life was like growing up in the 1960s!

The talk is part of the Reminiscence Caf&#233;, a community activity for those aged over 65 who are interested in socialising in an informal and friendly setting.

There will be tea, cake and plenty of opportunity to chat.

As with every Reminiscence Caf&#233;, the talk is hosted on the third Friday of the month (Friday 21 February) from 11am - 12.15pm. During the refurbishment at Twickenham Library, the Reminiscence Caf&#233; will meet at the Richmond Library Annexe.

This is a free event and no booking is required. For more information call 0208 734 3301 or email  [libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk).

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "Come along to the Reminiscence Caf&#233; and rediscover childhood memories from the 1960s - a decade that was entirely different to the one we live in today."

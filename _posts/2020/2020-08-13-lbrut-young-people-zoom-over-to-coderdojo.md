On Saturday 22 August, the computer programming club CoderDojo is hosting a demonstration of new, unreleased Scratch projects created by Raspberry Pi that will give young people a chance to experience what it's like to be a coding tester.

The demonstration starts at 1.00pm and you will need to book by emailing  [libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk).

Richmond CoderDojo is a free coding club open to those aged 7 to 17 with sessions on developing websites, apps, and games; or programming robots and other electronic devices.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Arts and Libraries, said:

> "CoderDojo is a great volunteer-led global movement that allows like-minded young people to learn how to code in a fun and sociable way.

> "In usual circumstances, CoderDojo involves meeting up but it's great that sessions are still taking place via Zoom so that young people can continue to develop important tech literacy skills.

> "If you are reading this and have computer coding knowledge, CoderDojo Richmond are looking for volunteer mentor so please email  [libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk) if you would like to be involved!"

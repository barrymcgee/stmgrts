Due to the pandemic, Richmond Council has set up or joined up with a number of programmes to help local families, groups, and businesses economically.  Here are a few announced recently.

## Council Tax support

The Council has agreed a financial package that will help around 1,700 of the borough's poorest households with their Council Tax bills.

With hard pressed families on the lowest incomes facing additional financial difficulties as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, Richmond Council will be offering targeted support to those already in receipt of Council Tax support, by discounting their Council Tax bills.

The reduction is expected to be up to &pound;150 and will be directed towards 1,700 families in the borough.

Over the next few weeks officers will look at how to implement the scheme.

## New Business Support programme

A new virtual programme of business support has been launched by Richmond Council and StartUp Richmond, offering practical help on how to build strength and resilience during and after the Corona Virus pandemic.

During the next 90 days, StartUp Richmond will deliver free business support to provide practical advice and guidance to help local businesses navigate through the current uncertain times and out the other side. The interactive programme will also serve as a platform to engage local business owners and to help them connect and work with each other.

The support will cover marketing and sales, finance, technology, health and well-being, legal, staffing and HR and business resilience.

There will be three web summits, three online workshops, one to one strategic business support sessions and free access to an online portal with a library of over 400 training programmes, available 24/7.

## New &pound;100k Coronavirus Emergency Grant to help charities and groups

Local charities, voluntary or community groups working hard to support residents impacted by COVID-19 are being encouraged to apply for grant funding to help them continue delivering vital support.

This new &pound;100k grant is aimed at organisations delivering local support to those affected by this public health emergency.

The Council has been working in close partnership with Richmond CVS, RUILS, Richmond AID and Age UK Richmond to co-ordinate the effort from thousands of volunteers and ensure that all those who need it receive support, from food deliveries to social care, with no-one left behind.

They have redesigned existing services and created new ones to continue supporting vulnerable residents during the lockdown.

However, many voluntary organisations are facing new financial challenges through increased demand for their services.

The new Council fund will give these organisations, who are facing financial challenges, help to continue their work in responding directly to the pandemic, above and beyond their normal activities.

It can only be used to meet the costs of delivering services directly to residents of Richmond upon Thames in response to Covid-19. Types of costs could include, but are not limited to:

- Building organisations capacity e.g. additional staffing / volunteer costs / equipment, transport or training
- Building stronger communities e.g. initiatives to provide practical support to local people - especially the most vulnerable and isolated
- Improving health and wellbeing e.g. projects that promote the health and wellbeing (physical and mental) of local residents.

The grant is in addition to a host of other available funding streams for local groups from regional and national funders

If you need extra support in applying for funding Richmond CVS can help.

## Grants available for local sports clubs and organisations

Local sporting clubs and community organisations are encouraged to apply for a grant to help keep the borough active during the coronavirus pandemic.

Sport England has made up to &pound;195 million of funding available to help its partners, clubs and community organisations cope with the impact of COVID-19.

The package of funding includes:

- A &pound;20 million Community Emergency Fund, which is open immediately for clubs and community organisations to bid into. Grants between &pound;300 and &pound;10,000 are available.
- A &pound;5 million pot for existing Sport England partners to bid into if they're facing specific financial difficulty
- &pound;55 million to support the sector during an ongoing period of restrictions; to fund new and innovative ways to keep people active and then, when it is over, to help organisations get back to business and adjust to a different environment.
- A &pound;115 million rollover of current funding into 2021/22 to give certainty to over 100 well established partners who play a vital role in the delivery of sport and physical activity in England.
- Full details, including the application process for the new Community Emergency Fund are available here on the [Sport England website](https://www.sportengland.org/news/195-million-package-help-sport-and-physical-activity-through-coronavirus).

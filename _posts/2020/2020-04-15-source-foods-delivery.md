Local catering company Source Foods is pleased to announce the launch of it home and office delivery service. For nearly 20 years Source has served local communities and businesses in west London through its stores in Richmond and Chiswick.

With the outbreak of Coronavirus we have set up a new home and office delivery service [Source Food](http://www.sourcefood.co.uk) that will deliver fresh food to homes and offices in Richmond, Kew, Isleworth, Putney, Barnes, Brentford and St Margarets.

Director and founder Jim Warner said:

> 'The current Covid crisis has made us re-think our business model - overnight our sales went to zero. What better way to adapt that start delivering our food to homes and offices in west London. We have a range of both prepared ready to eat food as well as packed food such as milk, eggs and flour. We are re-opening our kitchen and are able to offer a range of our popular salads - we aim to expand the range in the coming weeks.'

Our range is aimed primarily at families who want easy meal solutions. Our initial range has our kitchen made salads; sweet and savoury pies and cakes; Indian and middle eastern nibbles; store cupboard staples, fresh fruit and vegetables, eggs, milk, cheese and more. We have worked with our existing suppliers and adapted our range to suit families meal needs. We have worked with our suppliers over many years - most of whom are local and family based.

Charity link - Source has also set up a link with [Peardrops](https://www.peardrops.co.uk/) Peardrops currently distribute free and discounted meals to the homeless and elderly in central London. Our kitchen in Brentford will now act as a distribution hub so that meals can be distributed to those in need in west London.

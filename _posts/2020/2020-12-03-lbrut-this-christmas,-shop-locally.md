With the second lockdown over and Covid-secure businesses reopening, residents across the borough are strongly encouraged to shop locally this Christmas to support the local and independent businesses that make our high streets unique.

Richmond upon Thames has been placed under tier 2 restrictions meaning businesses and venues can reopen under certain conditions from yesterday (Wednesday 2 December).

To encourage everyone to support their local business community, the Richmond Card has teamed up with Visit Richmond to continue the #RichmondShopsLocal campaign. Keep an eye on the Council's social media channels this month, as well as the Visit Richmond pages, for shopping highlights in all of the Town Centres.

The Council is working closely with many local businesses to ensure their shops are safe to reopen for staff and customers.

Cllr Richard Baker, Lead Member for Business, Economics and Employment for Richmond Council, said:

> "The coronavirus pandemic has caused huge amounts of stress for our high-street businesses with many struggling to survive. Lots of residents will own or be employed by our local businesses and it's important that we support our local community as much as possible during this tough year.

> "Gifts from local shops always have more meaning and sentiment behind them rather than something ordered from a huge faceless online retailer. So, play your part this Christmas to help your local community and shop local!"

Hooray. Youpi. Hurra. Now the kids or grandchildren are back at school, why don't you too learn or perfect a language?

I am resuming our popular Spanish lesson, 1-1 or small groups, all levels welcome. There is a mini-group starting on Monday 19 October. Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like to try it out.

I also run adult French conversation classes from Intermediate to Advanced level with maximum 6 per group. There are limited spaces in person or on Zoom. N'h&#233;sitez pas si vous &#234;tes int&#233;ress&#233;(es).

If you are worried that language learning is only for children, [here is one of countless studies proving the opposite](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2NsHY4MhL95FgclByxS1XRl/can-learning-a-new-language-boost-your-brain).

[Please email or call for more information or to speak to a current student.](http://www.live-languages.com/contact-us)

A bient&#244;t. Hasta pronto :-)

Adrienne

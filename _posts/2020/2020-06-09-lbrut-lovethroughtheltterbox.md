Children are encouraged to write letters for older residents in the borough, who are amongst the most affected by the COVID-19 crisis and who might be feeling particularly lonely.

Lots of innovative ways have emerged to help us stay connected to others. However, many of these ways involve the use of technology, which is not always accessible to older generations and which is also leading to concerns over the amount of 'screen-time' children are subject to.

#LoveThroughTheLetterbox is an opportunity to bring back letter writing as an activity for children and help the older generation feel connected and less isolated. The letter doesn't necessarily have to include words, artwork and drawings are also welcomed.

Please encourage the young people in your life to write or draw positive messages in letters that will be delivered to care homes across the borough. Send your letters to Love Through The Letterbox, Civic Centre, 44 York Street, Twickenham, TW1 3BZ and Richmond Council will forward the letters to care homes that want to be involved. Please include a first name, year group and the name of the school that the young person attends so that the recipient can respond to the letter if they wish to.

There are 48 care homes in the borough and the Council supports over 600 older residents. It is hoped that this campaign spreads joy far and wide, so please help raise awareness of #LoveThroughTheLetterbox by using the hashtag on social media and sharing photos of the letters your young person has written.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services and Health Committee, said:

> "#LoveThroughTheLetterbox is a wonderful way to bring generations together during this difficult time.

> "It would be amazing to reach as many care home residents and older people in the borough as possible.

> "For many children, growing up with technology might mean that they have never written and posted a letter, so it should be an exciting activity for them to be involved in.

> "I hope this brings joy to all those involved!"

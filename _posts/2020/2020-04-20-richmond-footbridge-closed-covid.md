**Closure of Richmond Footbridge to secure social distancing**

There will no public access to the footbridge at Richmond Lock and Weir from 21 April, as part of continuing efforts to combat the coronavirus, the Port of London Authority (PLA) has announced.

The measure follows a lack of adherence by a minority of the bridge's users to a one-way system, introduced at Easter, which the PLA had hoped would enable the structure to remain open to pedestrians and cyclists.

Mark Towens, the PLA's harbour master for the upper tidal Thames, said: "Though the vast majority of people have respected the one-way system, a minority has sadly paid no attention. This unfortunately leaves us with no other option but to close the footbridge until further notice.

> "I'd like to thank all those who complied with the one-way system.

> "But without the closure, there remains a simply too high a risk of COVID-19 spreading, due to users meeting halfway across not being able stay safely two metres apart, as a result of the bridge's narrow structure.

> "We will lift the restrictions as soon as we can, in line with Government guidance."

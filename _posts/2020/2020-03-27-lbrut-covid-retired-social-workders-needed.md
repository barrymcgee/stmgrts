Retired social workers are being urged by Richmond Council to return to work and help support Richmond residents through the coronavirus pandemic.

Richmond Council is making provisions to offer 7-day-week services, from 8am-8pm, to cope with the increased demand anticipated over the coming months.

Since the start of the pandemic, the local need has significantly increased and these additional pressures have meant that more qualified social workers are needed to help some of the most vulnerable residents in the borough.

A local campaign has been launched to recruit out-of-work social workers and invite those who have recently retired to temporarily return to work to help with the effort.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> "Ensuring that all our vulnerable residents are able to access the support they need is the number one priority for the Council at this time.

> "The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is putting a huge amount of pressure on our already very stretched social work teams.

> "They are all doing a tremendous job. But the demand for social care services is only going to increase as the pandemic continues. By recruiting those social workers who are not currently in employment and supporting retired social workers to return to work, it could be a significant boost for the local community."

People who think they may have contracted Coronavirus can get tested at a special temporary testing centre run by the army in Richmond Town Centre today and on Wednesday.

In addition to the drive-in testing centre at Twickenham Stadium, a mobile testing unit will be [offering tests](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested) in Richmond between 9.30am and 3.30pm on both May 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>. Appointments are available online.

The Council is not permitted to reveal the location of the test centre. The location will only be provided upon confirmation of the booking.

Please note the test will not show if you have already had Covid-19, only if you have the infection on the day of the test.

The tests are being offered to the following categories of people - and if appropriate members of the same household.

- All those working on the frontline in health and social care (with or without symptoms)
- Patients in the NHS and residents in care homes (with or without symptoms)
- All essential workers with symptom anyone over 65 with symptoms
- Anyone who goes into work because they cannot work from home (e.g. construction workers, emergency plumbers and those in similar occupations) and has symptoms
- Anyone who has symptoms and lives with someone who meets any of the above criteria
- You can also apply for a test if you have a clinical referral from NHS 111 online.

Tests are being offered by appointment only. [These must be booked online via the Government's web portal.](https://self-referral.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/)

A full list of those classed as essential workers is published on the [Gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#essential-workers).

It includes anyone working in the NHS or social care settings plus those working in the transport, education or food distribution sectors, including shops and supermarkets along with key public services like the police, fire brigade, prisons, schools, the postal service, bus, rail and tube workers. Tests are also being offered to members of their household if they are displaying any symptoms.

The main symptoms of the disease are:

- A high temperature - this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
- A new, continuous cough - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual).

To qualify for a test those attending must bring with them some form of identification or verification letter demonstrating that they are, or another member of their household is, an essential worker. This could be a staff ID badge, or letter or email from an employer.

People can attend the test centre by car, on bikes or on foot, but those who can arrive by car are being urged to do so if possible in order to maintain social distancing rules.

Leader of Richmond Council, Cllr Gareth Roberts, said:

> "A key element of the strategy to eradicate this virus is to conduct as many tests as possible, especially for essential workers and those most at risk.

> "If you are elderly, a key worker or covered by an of the categories listed above, and either you or a close member of your family has developed symptoms of Coronavirus, then please come and get tested."

Those tested will receive their results 48 hours later.

New knitting and needle craft groups will meet once a month for friendly chats, tea, biscuits and crafts.

Groups will meet once a month from 10am - 12 noon. Simply bring yarn and needles or your own project with you to join.

The Richmond Lending Library will host a group every third Thursday of the month (beginning 16 January), East Sheen Library will be every second Thursday of the month (beginning 9 January), and Castelnau Library will be every third Friday of the month (beginning 17 January).

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "Crafting is a wonderful way to have fun, clear the mind and improve your memory. It is a very affordable hobby and easy to join in on, even if you don't have any experience. So, why not get involved and express your creativity in a new craft group this year."

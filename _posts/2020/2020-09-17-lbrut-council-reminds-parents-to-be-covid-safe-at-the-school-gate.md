Parents are asked by the Council to remember to social distance and wear face coverings if possible at the school gates, to prevent the spread of Covid19.

As children and young people have been returning to schools over the past few weeks, Richmond Council has written to all parents and carers to ask them to be considerate of others, including the local community, whilst dropping off or picking up their children.

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee, said:

> "All of our schools are working hard to make sure that children are safe whilst they are at school. However, we also need the support of parents, grandparents and carers when they are at the school gates.

> "We have received reports from local residents and other concerned parents, of gatherings of people, sometimes outside of people's homes, particularly at pick up time. We are worried about the potential for spreading the virus that these gatherings present.

> "I remind everyone doing the school run - Covid19 has not gone away. We all need to work together to beat the virus. Please remember to keep your distance, don't gather in groups of more than six and if you can - please wear a face covering.

> "Some schools are now putting stewards outside to help move along large groups of people. But we all need to do our bit."

Richmond Library Services are looking for residents to share their experiences of life during lockdown to help future studies on how we coped during the coronavirus pandemic.

Many people will already be keeping diaries of their experiences during this time; if not, it's not too late to start. The Local Studies Library and Archive is inviting residents to share their recordings, which may include your daily routine, your struggles and your thoughts.

We are living through a significant period of history and people's diaries will allow those who come to study it to see how the pandemic really affected the people's lives.

Diaries are private and the Local Studies Library & Archive will respect this. The diaries will be kept secure and closed to the public until all the people mentioned in the diaries have passed away. If diary-creators are happy for their diary to be made public earlier, the Local Studies Library & Archive will simply need signed statements from the creator and everyone mentioned within the diary.

Once the crisis is over and the Local Studies Library & Archive is open again, residents will be able to post, drop-off or email their diaries to the Library. [More details can be found here](http://libraryblog.lbrut.org.uk/wordpress/2020/04/making-history-life-in-lockdown/).

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "This is a surreal situation to be in as we are currently living through a significant part of history. While statistics play an important part in recording history, diaries will allow future generations to understand the observations and feelings of people living through the crisis.

> "Anything you record will be helpful, it doesn't need to be written to a certain standard. You can view it as a creative project to be involved in that will be of genuine historic worth!

> "Keeping a diary can also help to improve mental wellbeing - it gives the writer structure and a place to store thoughts and feelings."

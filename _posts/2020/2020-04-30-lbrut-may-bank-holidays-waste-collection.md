With two bank holidays coming up in May, on Friday 8 May and Monday 25 May, Richmond Council will carry out general waste, food waste and recycling collections for domestic properties one day later than usual, immediately following the bank holidays.

In 2020, the Early May Bank Holiday has been moved from the usual first Monday in May, to the following Friday (8 May) to coincide with the VE Day 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary

Only collections scheduled for that Friday will be affected, those residents should put their refuse and recycling out for collection on Saturday 9 May. Normal collections will resume on Monday 11 May.

The Spring Bank Holiday is on Monday 25 May. All collections that week will take place one day later than usual. For example, Monday collections will happen on the Tuesday, and Tuesday collections will happen on the Wednesday. Normal collections will resume on Monday 1 June.

The garden waste service remains suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but residents can still purchase composting units to help manage green waste during this time. Guidance is available at richmond.gov.uk/other_ways_to_recycle_garden_waste  There will be no change for those receiving commercial waste and recycling collection services.

Residents are reminded that waste and recycling collections are completed by the new contractor using trucks that have 'split body' compartments at the rear meaning they each take separately two waste or recycling streams. Food waste and general refuse are collected in the same truck.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, if residents are self-isolating and feeling ill they should continue to put any potentially infected items (like used tissues or cleaning cloths) into separate plastic bags and double-bag them. These bags should be stored for 72 hours before being put in with general waste for collection.

For all enquiries about collections, please telephone 020 8891 1411. Further information is available at [www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling).

    At our Twickenham Studios campus in St Margarets we have been delivering world class Films and TV for over 100 years. In that time, we have achieved some extraordinary success from our cutting-edge facilities, including Oscar-winning sound work on Bohemian Rhapsody just last year amongst many others. We now want to build on that success while reimagining ourselves as more a part of the local community here in St Margarets.

At our Twickenham Studios campus in St Margarets we have been delivering world class Films and TV for over 100 years. In that time, we have achieved some extraordinary success from our cutting-edge facilities, including Oscar-winning sound work on Bohemian Rhapsody just last year amongst many others. We now want to build on that success while reimagining ourselves as more a part of the local community here in St Margarets.

As part of a consultancy site redevelopment phase we have submitted initial proposals which would see the introduction of new creative space on St Margarets Road providing studios, private offices and shared 'flexi' workspaces for the creative industries and the community to collaborate and thrive in. The new building would provide the opportunity to complete the corner of St Margarets Road and The Barons with active frontage onto the already vibrant high street. Once again providing the studios with the High Street presence that it originally enjoyed from its inception in 1913.

With the introduction of a boutique screening cinema and cafe/bar as part of the redevelopment, TW1 would also support the local economy and add an exciting new facility to the community - complementing existing local restaurants, pubs, cafes and shops.

Overall our goal is to make the Twickenham Studios sustainable for the next 25 years and beyond, so we also want to improve our offering to lead the way with the latest innovation trends and technologies whilst also allowing us to play a wider role in our neighbourhood.

Children aged 4-11 are encouraged to join the Silly Squad for this year's Summer Reading Challenge.

The Summer Reading Challenge, which runs until September, is the biggest children's reading for pleasure programme in the UK and is delivered by The Reading Agency.

This year, children can sign up to the challenge by heading to [www.sillysquad.org.uk](http://www.sillysquad.org.uk )and creating a personal profile. Here they can set reading goals, keep a record of their reading achievements and view book recommendations. Silly Squad aims to be fun and so users can unlock all sorts of activities, games and rewards.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "This is a lovely initiative to encourage children to read in a fun and silly way whilst Richmond's libraries remain closed. By incorporating games and challenges, I'm sure every young person will want to be a member of the Silly Squad!"

Whilst libraries remain closed in accordance with government guidance, online library services are open 24/7. Richmond Card holders can access free eBooks, eAudiobooks, eMagazines, an online music library, and many more online services.

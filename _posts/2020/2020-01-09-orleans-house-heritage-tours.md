Our free, weekly Heritage Tours will allow you to immerse yourself in the past and gain an insight into what has shaped this building over the centuries. Our volunteer guides will paint you a picture of grand banquets, royal visits and much more!

Bring your friends and family as part of a day out, or if you're part of a local group or organisation, why not include the gallery as part of your outings and activities?

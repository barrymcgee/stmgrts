An innovative new method for repairing the borough's roads is being rolled out this week as Richmond Council has taken delivery of its thermal repair equipment.

Following a successful pilot in June, the Council will now use the technology to carry out a range of road repairs throughout the borough. The first programme of works will be carried out in Barnes over the next week.

This thermal repair process has many benefits, such as, it is more environmentally friendly, has a reduced carbon footprint, and delivers better value. It allows contractors to heat the existing damaged road material until it is soft enough to be reshaped as a partial filling for the pothole, speeding repair times by up to 40%.

By reheating the existing road surface, there will be no need to remove the old material, which greatly reduces the disposal of waste material and the amount of new asphalt material required. In addition, carbon emissions are reduced by removing the need for power tools which use fossil fuels. This also means the new thermal method is quieter and more suitable for repairs in areas of the borough where noise pollution is an issue.

The Council's engineers will examine damaged roads to determine whether the new technology is suitable for repairs. Ideal roads are typically those that have areas with potholes, where potholes have previously been temporarily fixed, roads containing failed utility company trenches could be more suitable for resurfacing.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee, said:

> "I saw the pilot in action during the summer and this cutting-edge technology will have a significant impact; helping us to ensure more potholes are filled and all in a shorter time.

> "The Council is continually striving to improve services, deliver better value and embrace technological advances, so I am delighted we have secured this new equipment to improve our road repair work. This technology is just the latest example of our Council's restless determination to keep delivering improved services for its residents."

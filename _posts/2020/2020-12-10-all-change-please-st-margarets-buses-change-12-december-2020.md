Several changes to local buses come into force this Saturday, 12 December 2020.

### Route H37

Route H37 will continue to run between Hounslow, Blenheim Centre and Richmond, Manor Circus with a new timetable in operation on all days of the week.

From Monday to Friday the H37 will run every 7-8 minutes during the AM peak, midday and PM peak period and every 12 minutes in the evening. The Saturday service will be every 7-8 minutes during the day and 12 minutes in the evening. Sundays will see buses running every 20-30 minutes in the early morning then every 10 minutes during the daytime and 12 minutes in the evening.

### Route 110

Route 110 which currently runs between Hounslow and West Middlesex Hospital will be diverted at Powder Mill Lane to run to Hammersmith Bus Station via Percy Road, Whitton, Warren Road, Twickenham Stadium, St Margarets Station and Richmond Bridge to Richmond Town Centre then via the current 391 to Hammersmith Bus Station. Buses will run non-stop between Twickenham Stadium and St Margarets Station in both directions while we await the installation of bus stops along Chertsey Road. Route 391 will be withdrawn from this date. Route H22 will be restructured to serve West Middlesex Hospital.

On Monday to Fridays the 110 will be increased in frequency to run every 15 minutes during the AM peak, midday and PM peak periods and every 20 minutes in the evening. The Saturday service will be every 15 minutes during the day and every 20 minutes in the evening. Sundays will see buses running every 30 minutes in the early morning and then every 20 minutes for the rest of the day.

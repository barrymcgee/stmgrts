Richmond businesses can take part in a free online workshop to help them "Survive the Lockdown and Come out Fighting" next month.

Run by StartUp Richmond - supported by Richmond Council, the free online summit aims to provide businesses with practical advice to help them navigate their business through the current uncertain times and out the other side.

StartUp Richmond has gathered together a team of business experts from across all aspects of business life to provide advice and guidance to help businesses meet the challenges facing them. They will cover areas such as finance, technology, staffing, business resilience, insurance, legal issues, marketing and sales.

The session is on **Thursday 2 April from 2-5pm**.  To see information about the experts and to register go:  [my.demio.com/ref/rO8XlYI984KgT16x](https://my.demio.com/ref/rO8XlYI984KgT16x)

Cllr Geoff Acton, Lead Member for Business at Richmond Council, said:

> "This is the most challenging time for most of our local businesses. We know that many of the businesses who are closed are hugely worried that the uncertainty around the pandemic means that they are fearful they may never reopen.

> "We have already announced a number of grants and local measures that we are taking to help our local businesses. This Summit will give businesses a chance to hear some of the other ideas that will help them survive the crisis."

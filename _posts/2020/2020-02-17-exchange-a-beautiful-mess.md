Director Peter Cutts thought life would ease when he downsized from NW London to Teddington.  However, after meeting the writer Rachel Goth, he is bringing together an accomplished cast and creative team to perform 'A Beautiful Mess' at Twickenham's new theatre, The Exchange, on Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> March. Ana Ines Jabares Pita, soon to open a show at the RSC, designs for a cast that includes National Theatre player Daniel Millar and actor Felicity Sparks who recently returned from Santiago with the acclaimed company 1927.

After touring solo shows throughout the country, presenting poetry programmes for BBC Radio, directing numerous writing and performance projects, and teaching directing and ensemble theatre at universities in America, Peter was ready to relax a little. However, the lure of playwriting workshops at The Rose Theatre, Kingston, proved too much to resist. As a result, he and Rachel, who also attended the course, embarked on a project presenting a series of short plays at The Guildhall Library in the City. These have now emerged as a production that explores the strangely familiar world of guilt, fear, love and conception from the inside out.

Peter is riding on the creative buzz that this corner of SW London has to offer, with its numerous theatres, both amateur and professional, offering a wide range of excellent work. He is delighted that The Exchange, his local theatre, is supporting this new venture. It has inspired him to create a vibrant, exciting company to take on this project. "It's a joy to work with this talented, generous group of people to explore the world of dating, desire and heartbreak," he says. "If you're curious to discover how a precocious priest can steer a confession towards conception, or how the hidden characters living inside our heads are pulling the strings, 'A Beautiful Mess' on Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> March may well be quite revealing".

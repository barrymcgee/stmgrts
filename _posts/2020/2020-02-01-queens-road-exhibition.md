*1st February - 5<sup>th</sup> September 2020*

The Museum of Richmond is celebrating over 500 years of Richmond's social history through its exciting new exhibition '[Queen's Road: 500 Years of History](/event/exhibition/200705147465)' which opens on Saturday 1<sup>st</sup> February 2020.

Once a muddy track through the Richmond countryside, Queen's Road is unrecognisable today. Discover the fascinating history of this road, including farmland owned by Tudor courtiers, a pest house for plague sufferers, grand Victorian developments and innovative social housing.

Uncover Richmond's long forgotten windmill, see inside the designs of stunning Dutch style houses, and meet some of the road's notable characters from Comptroller of the Tudor Royal household to a World War Two refugee and notable journalist.

The exhibition will be accompanied by a series of events including an evening talk by Charles Pineles in collaboration with the Richmond Local History Society on the social history of Queen's Road on Monday 9<sup>th</sup> March. There are also Curator's Tours at the Museum on the 15<sup>th</sup> February and 14<sup>th</sup> March at 2pm and a series of local history family workshops taking place.

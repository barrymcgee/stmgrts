Over 2,000 Richmond upon Thames parents applied for a secondary school place in 2020. Sixty one percent of applicants received a first preference offer and 83% received an offer at one of their first three preferences.

In London, parents express preferences for secondary schools both inside and outside the borough in which they live, making them far more likely to be oversubscribed than in other parts of England.  Nearly all applicants who applied by the deadline have received an offer of a place.

Currently, 135 children have not been offered a place. However, as parents accept or decline their offers over the next few weeks and months, it is anticipated that all children without a school place will be offered one from the waiting-lists as quickly as possible.  The School Admissions team will be able to reassure and advise parents. They will monitor the progress of applications of children who are without an offer at this initial stage of the admissions process and will do all they can to ensure that parents' wait for a school place is minimal.

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee, said:

> "Our secondary schools remain very popular!

> "Over 60% of our students have been offered a place at their first preference of school, which is around the same as last year. I expect this figure to continue to rise as we increase choice and improvements across our schools.  We are confident that by the summer all children will have a placement as places become available from waiting lists as parents move out of the area or make alternative arrangements for their child's education.

> "I understand the anxiety that parents whose children have yet to be offered a place will be feeling, and I would like to assure them that their children will be placed as quickly as possible."

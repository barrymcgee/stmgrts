Garden waste collections are being paused from Monday 30 March, until further notice, to direct resources into ensuring weekly household waste and recycling collections can continue during the Coronavirus pandemic.

The Council have stressed that household collection of general rubbish bins and recycling boxes are currently uninterrupted - and residents are asked to put out their bins and boxes as they normally would. Do not put out your garden waste bin from Monday - it will not be collected.

However, it is important for people to remember that the Townmead Road Reuse and Recycling centre in Kew has also been temporarily closed, following Government guidance. Therefore, garden waste should not be taken there as an alternative.

Those keen to utilise the good weather and time at home by doing gardening are encouraged to consider home composting. Residents can produce their own compost at home using suitable kitchen and/or garden waste. The waste will provide a supply of peat-free compost that will improve the soil quality of gardens.

Those unable to compost are asked to store their waste securely in their gardens until the service is reintroduced. Residents are asked to not place garden waste in with the household waste collection, as it will not be taken by collection crews.

Residents who have subscribed to the Garden Waste service will have their subscriptions frozen for the duration that the service will not be delivered.  Garden Waste sacks can still be ordered from richmond.gov.uk for &pound;16.40 per 10 bags (postage fees waived).

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of the Environment, Sustainability, Culture and Sport Committee, said:

> "During this challenging time for everyone it is important that we resource our most important services.

> "Due to the developing situation and latest national advice regarding Covid-19, our waste collection services are currently operating with a reduced number of staff.

> "By postponing the garden waste collections, we are able to use these vehicles, drivers and loaders to support general rubbish and recycling collections, which must be prioritised.

> "This decision was made jointly with our operational partner.

> "Since garden waste collection is an opt-in paid-for scheme, customers will have their subscriptions frozen while the service is paused.

> "We apologise for any inconvenience caused, and we thank you for your continued understanding and patience in these exceptional circumstances."

This year's Community Heroes programme will recognise more people than ever before - celebrating those who voluntarily help improve the lives of residents and the wider community, as well as recognising those who have gone above and beyond to help with the borough's Covid-19 response.

To kickstart the programme, residents are being asked to share their personal experiences of either giving or receiving help during the Covid-19 pandemic. If you have volunteered or worked on the frontline, we want you to write about your experience. Similarly, if you know someone that has gone above and beyond to help others during this time, we want you to let us know about this individual so that their hard work can be recognised.

For example, you might have fundraised for a local cause or gone beyond expectations with supporting someone isolating through the pandemic; you might know someone who has made PPE or united their local community. Whatever inspiring story it may be - we want to hear it about it!

The stories will be shared widely through the Council's social media channels.

You can submit your own story or the story of someone you know who is a COVID-19 Community Hero. There are a few ways to share your story:

- Video: film a short video clip, ideally only 1 minute (no more than 2 minutes)
- Audio: record a short audio clip, ideally only 1 minute (no more than 2 minutes) along with a photo
- Written: no more than 200 words, along with a photo

Please send all submissions to  [campaigns@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:campaigns@richmond.gov.uk) by Friday 5 September. You can also share your story on social media using #RichmondCovidHeroes.

The Community Heroes Awards ceremony will take place later this year, either virtually or (depending on Government guidance) with an event. Nominations will open in the autumn with more information to follow later this summer.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Lead Member for Communities and the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "I have always been amazed by the number of individuals and groups in this borough who commit themselves to improving the lives of others and the community that we live in.

> "Covid-19 has been devastating in so many ways. The one silver lining has been the incredible willingness of residents and organisations to help. The community has played an enormous role in the borough's response and we want the Community Heroes programme to recognise this.

> "That's why we're beginning this year's awards with a huge thank you to all those who have helped over the past five months. We want to recognise and celebrate these individuals by telling their stories - so please share your experiences with us."

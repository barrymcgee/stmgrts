Following the Easter Bank Holidays on Friday 10 April and Monday 13 April, Richmond Council will carry out general rubbish, food waste and recycling collections for domestic properties one day later than usual.

For example, Friday collections will take place on Saturday and Monday collections on the Tuesday. The garden waste service remains suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There will be no change for those receiving commercial waste and recycling collection services.

Normal domestic collection schedules for the general rubbish, food waste and recycling will resume a week later on Monday 20 April. Residents are asked to put recycling or refuse out early on collection day at the boundary of their property, i.e. where your front path or drive meets the road or pavement, but not to leave it on the streets the day before to avoid bags being ripped and to keep roads clean and tidy.

Residents are reminded that if they are self-isolating and feeling ill, to put any potentially infected items (like used tissues or cleaning cloths) into separate plastic bags and double-bag them. These bags should then be put aside for at least 72 hours (3 days) before being put into an external bin.

The Household Waste and Recycling Centre at Townmead Road remains closed until further notice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents are encouraged to avoid doing any major clear-outs, DIY or gardening jobs during this time and to responsibly store their waste until normal services resume.

For all enquiries about collections, please telephone 020 8891 1411. Further information is available at [www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/waste_and_recycling)

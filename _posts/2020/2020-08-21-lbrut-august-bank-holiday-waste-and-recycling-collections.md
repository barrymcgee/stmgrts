Following the Bank Holiday on Monday 31 August, Richmond Council will carry out general waste, food waste and recycling collections for domestic properties one day later than usual.

For example, Monday collections will take place on Tuesday and Friday collections on the Saturday. There will be no change for those receiving commercial waste and recycling collection services.

Normal domestic collection schedules will resume a week later on Monday 7 September. Residents are asked to put recycling or refuse out by 6am on the morning of the collection day, but not to leave it on the streets the day before to avoid bags being ripped and to keep roads clean and tidy.

Waste should be put out in securely tied sacks or in a bin with a lid which assists with preventing animal attacks and people adding litter.

Changes to collection days also apply to garden waste.

The Household Waste and Recycling Centre at Townmead Road will be open on the Bank Holiday Monday and will be operating Sunday hours - 9.00am to 4.00pm with last admission at 3.45pm. However, residents are reminded that they MUST book an appointment online before they visit. Only residents with an appointment will be given access to the site. To book your slot, go to: [www.richmond.gov.uk/townmead_road](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/townmead_road)

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, if residents are self-isolating and feeling ill they should continue to put any potentially infected items (like used tissues or cleaning cloths) into separate plastic bags and double-bag them. These bags should be stored for 72 hours before being put in with general waste for collection.

For all enquiries about collections, please telephone 020 8891 1411. See more information about waste and recycling.

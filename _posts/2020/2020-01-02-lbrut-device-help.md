Did you recently purchase or receive a digital device over Christmas but are unsure how to get the best out of it? Our friendly Libraries Team have a range of sessions to help you get the most out of your new tablet, laptop or mobile phone.

Last year the team helped over 850 people get to grips with their digital gadgets and this year they want to help even more people.

You can bring your new device along to one of a number of local drop-in sessions and get tips and advice from the knowledgeable staff. No booking is required just turn up on the day.

Sessions will cover the basics about applications, social media, use of the internet, online shopping and emailing friends and family.

Regular sessions are held at the Information and Reference Library in Richmond:

|Date|Time|
|----|----|
|Tuesday 14 January 2020|2.30pm to 3.30pm|
|Friday 17 January 2020|10.30am to 11.30am|
|Monday 20 January 2020|2.30pm to 3.30pm|
|Thursday 23 January 2020|10.30am to 11.30am|

A range of other IT taster sessions are also available in local libraries, either at set times or by arrangement. Please contact your local library for further details of how to book a session.

Cllr John Coombs, Arts and Culture Champion for Richmond Council, said:

> "Many people will have received new digital devices this Christmas and in addition, with more Council and partner services available online, we want to encourage all residents to get comfortable using their new tablets, laptops and phones. These sessions will be a great help.

> "Our libraries team are friendly and knowledgeable, so bring your new device and any questions you have and they'll help you get the best out of your new tech."

A new art exhibition 'Beyond the Frame' is coming to Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham on 22 February.

The exhibition will see eighteen artists take pieces from the Richmond Borough Art Collection and extend them to take the viewer beyond the depicted view. It will feature an eclectic mix of new artwork that explores what is happening around well-known landscapes and views.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "Orleans House Gallery has an exciting line up of exhibitions this year. It has three galleries that show different exhibitions, making it well worth a visit.

> "Beyond the Frame offers an unusual opportunity to see artists extend other artists' work. The exhibition is free to visit and runs until the end of May 2020."

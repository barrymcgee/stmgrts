Residents are invited to join the Council and Police and have their say on community safety issues, sharing their ideas on local priorities in a series of virtual community engagement events.

The Council will be hosting a series of dedicated discussions on Community Safety, in partnership with the local Police. Those who wish to attend their local event, can pre-register here. Once registered they will be sent a personal link and will be able to log in and hear from their local Police representatives and their local ward councillors live.

Attendees will be invited to have their say via video on community safety in their local area and give their ideas.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Lead Member for Communities, Equalities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "It was clear following the first round of virtual events that Community Safety is a top issue that people want to discuss, so I am pleased that our colleagues from the Police can join us in this next round of dedicated and localised community conversations.

> "Coronavirus hasn't gone away. And throughout the pandemic we have been committed to trying to find new, innovative ways to engage and keep in touch with residents.

The Community Conversation is chance for ward councillors to hear what matters most to residents and businesses and share ideas about the future of local areas. Over the past few years, events have been held in every area across the borough.

Due to the pandemic, physical events are currently not possible, therefore earlier this year the Council trialled online engagement sessions using Zoom. Over 1,200 people registered for the first round of events, sharing their thoughts on issues such as impact of Coronavirus, community safety, environmental issues and education.

Residents and businesses can sign up to attend and event in their local area here: [www.richmond.gov.uk/community_conversation](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_conversation)

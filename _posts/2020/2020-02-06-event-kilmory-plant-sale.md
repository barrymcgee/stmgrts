Bring wildlife back into your garden this spring! Come along to the Environment Trust Plant Sale for Wildlife and Open Day at the Grade II listed Kilmorey Mausoleum in St Margarets on Sunday 26<sup>th</sup> April.

With a great selection of plants to encourage and sustain local wildlife including annuals, perennials, herbs, grasses, shrubs and many more this year's Plant Sale promises to be our biggest yet! Whether you have a huge garden or tiny outside space, there will be plenty of bargain plants to get your backyard buzzing.

Sadly, our wild animals and plants have been losing their homes over the last 50 years. (State of Nature report, 2016). But we can all play a part in helping to reverse the decline. Many of the most beautiful garden plants are attractive to wildlife and any garden, however small, can be turned into a sanctuary.
There is something for everyone at the Environment Trust Plant Sale and Open Day. Children will enjoy the adventurous nature trail through the wildlife garden. They can learn about the vital work bees and hedgehogs do from nature experts and make a mini-bee-nursery for their garden to expand their habitat.
For those keen on local history, the mausoleum with its secret tunnel and a story of passion and betrayal, reveals a fascinating insight to Lord Kilmorey and his mistress, Priscilla. Hear the full story from our expert volunteer guides.

A &pound;3 entry fee (members of the Trust and kids go free) includes refreshment, a tour of the mausoleum and the wildlife garden. The first 50 visitors will get a free pack of "bee friendly wildflower seeds". Homemade cakes will be available, as well as lots of great raffle prizes. There is unrestricted parking in the area all day and all proceeds will support the work of Environment Trust to improve, preserve and protect our local neighbourhood.
Environment Trust is grateful for any donations of plants so whether you are an experienced gardener or still developing your green fingers, please get in touch.

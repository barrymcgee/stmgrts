Residents are invited to have their say on community issues, feedback their experiences of the Covid19 pandemic, and share their ideas on local priorities following the impact of the pandemic, in a series of virtual community engagement events.

The Community Conversation is chance for ward councillors to hear what matters most to residents and businesses and share ideas about the future of local areas. Over the past few years, events have been held in every area across the borough.

Due to the pandemic, physical events are currently not possible, therefore the Council is trialling online engagement sessions using Zoom. The first trial event was held earlier this month for residents in Ham, Petersham and Richmond Riverside. Nearly 80 residents logged in - sharing their thoughts on issues such as impact of Coronavirus, cycling, Richmond Park, public transport, community safety and accessibility.

The Council is now rolling out the programme to all other wards across the borough. Those who wish to attend their local event, can [pre-register here](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/council/have_your_say/community_conversation). Once registered they will be sent a personal link and will be able to log in and hear from the Leader of the Council and their local ward councillors live.

Attendees will be invited to have their say via video or text chat on what Coronavirus has meant for them and their local area and give their ideas on what needs to be done to help the recovery process in their local area.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Lead Member for Communities, Equalities and the Voluntary Sector said:

> "Coronavirus hasn't gone away. And whilst our face-to-face meetings were popular, it currently isn't possible to hold them whilst social distancing measures are in place.

We don't want to wait until later in the year to really understand how our communities have been impacted.

> "The Council will have to make some important decisions over the next few months, and we want to do it in partnership with the community. We also want residents to have the ability to put in place local activities and measures themselves - so we will have a series of grants that will enable that to happen.

> "For many people virtual meetings and meet-ups is now second nature. And whilst I know that we will return to physical meetings in the future - the feedback from our first trial session showed us that for many people, at this time virtual is a preferred option."

Residents and businesses can sign up to attend and event in their local area here: [www.richmond.gov.uk/community_conversation](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_conversation)

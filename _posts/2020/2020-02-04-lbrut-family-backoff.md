The gloves are off... oven gloves that is, for this year's Richmond upon Thames Fairtrade Family Bakeoff.

All you have to do is to leap into action this 29<sup>th</sup> February, during Fairtrade Fortnight, and bake something fantastic for a baking competition at the Old Town Hall in Richmond.

The event has been organised by Richmond Council's Fairtrade Steering group, a cross-party group of councillors who aim to encourage the use of Fairtrade ingredients across the borough.

Fairtrade is a global movement for change that works directly with businesses, consumers and campaigners to make trade deliver for farmers and workers. By buying Fairtrade approved products you are ensuring decent working conditions, local sustainability, and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers in the developing world.

All entrants in the Richmond Fairtrade Bakeoff competition will be asked to submit a list of their ingredients and bake their extravaganza using as many Fairtrade ingredients as possible.

Children and adults are invited to take part. All entries will be judged by the Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, Cllr Nancy Baldwin. Prizes will be announced on the day.

Bring in your favourite family fair trade bakes from noon-1pm. Winners announced at 2pm.

Cllr Nancy Baldwin, said:

> "This is another great Fairtrade event, getting the message about sustainable food, local shopping and food production out to the community.

> "The key message remains the same. We want to encourage more people to buy Fairtrade products - including the ingredients needed for this baking bonanza! We all have a role to play in looking after the food we love and the people who grow it! Farmers in developing countries desperately need our support, and we need more people to buy products carrying the Fairtrade mark.

> "We hope that everyone who takes part enjoys it as much as I'm sure I will."

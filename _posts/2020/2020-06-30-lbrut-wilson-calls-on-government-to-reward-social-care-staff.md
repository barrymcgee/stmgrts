Munira Wilson, MP for Twickenham, has urged the Government to honour the "immense sacrifice and service" that social care workers have made for this country during the pandemic.

Speaking in a House of Commons debate, Munira called for improved pay conditions and rewards for social care workers, given many are low-paid for the highly skilled work they do.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Munira said:

> "In social care, two million people in care jobs are largely on the minimum wage. Half are on zero-hours contracts, yet they are undertaking highly skilled work, taking care of the most vulnerable and providing intimate care.

> "The case for ensuring that our careworkers are at the very least paid the real living wage is overwhelming and a moral imperative."

Following her speech, Munira said:

> "Social care workers have made huge sacrifices during this crisis. They have put their lives on the line day in and day out to care for our loved ones, often without the personal protective equipment they need.

> "Yet so often their pay conditions and rewards do not reflect the immense service they provide to our country. It is all too common for social care staff to not even be paid the living wage. This is despite the highly skilled nature of their job.

> "This situation is wholly unjust. The Government must urgently bring forward reforms in the system so that their pay can be improved. For too long, the vital work these staff do has been overlooked.

The number of people registering for one of Richmond Libraries online services has increased by 365%, as residents in the borough look for ways to entertain themselves whilst staying home and saving lives during the coronavirus pandemic.

The percentage compares the number of new users signing up to Richmond Libraries popular Libby service in March 2020 to March 2019. Library EBook issues are also up by 70% overall.

Richmond Libraries online services are open 24/7. Libby is one of the free apps that allow users to easily access eBooks and eAudiobooks from their local libraries. All you need is internet access and a Richmond Card to be able to delve into thousands of eBooks, eAudiobooks and eMagazines.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "Our libraries offer a vital service to residents during normal times and it is reassuring that the service is able to continue to do this digitally.

> "This is a stressful time for everyone, and reading can be a great way of relaxing and looking after your wellbeing whilst staying home and saving lives."

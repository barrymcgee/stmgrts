The Mayor at the Greater London Authority has decided to review the Planning Committee decision on the future of the Stag Brewery site in Mortlake.

On 29 January the Planning Committee resolved to approve Applications A and B for the redevelopment of the Stag Brewery and refuse Application C for the Chalkers Corner highway works, subject to no adverse direction or call in by the Greater London Authority or the National Planning Casework Unit.

The first application (Application A) incorporated a master plan for how the site would be developed - including residential units, a cinema, hotel, care home, pedestrian and cycle routes, on-site cycling provision and new public open space, amenity and place space. The Maltings would be retained and sit adjacent to a new plaza looking out over the River Thames, a linear park would be created linking this to Mortlake Green.

The second application (Application B) considered proposals for the erection of a three-storey building to provide a new secondary school with sixth form; Sports pitch with floodlighting, external MUGA and play space; and associated external works including, landscaping, car and cycle parking, new access routes and associated works.

The third application (Application C) proposed the reconfiguration of Chalkers Corner traffic junction, to include existing public highway and existing landscaped and informal parking area associated with Chertsey Court, to facilitate alterations to lane configuration, a new cycle lane, works to existing pedestrian and cycle crossing, soft landscaping and replacement boundary treatment to Chertsey Court.

The applications were formally referred to the Greater London Authority in April, and on Monday 4 May, Jules Pipe CBE, the Deputy Mayor for Planning, Regeneration and Skills issued the Stage 2 referral report and Direction that the Mayor will call in and thereby act as the local planning authority for the purposes of determining all three planning applications.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) concluded "whilst the principle of the redevelopment for a residential-led mixed use development and a school is supported, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals optimise the delivery of affordable housing, and neither has it been satisfactorily demonstrated that the highways impacts of the proposal would be suitably mitigated".  Thereby the proposed development would have a significant impact on the implementation of the London Plan.

The Greater London Authority will hold a public hearing before deciding whether or not to grant planning permission for the three applications, which will be announced 1 week in advance of the meeting taking place.

Cllr Martin Elengorn, Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee, said:

> "The Planning Committee very thoroughly considered the arguments for and against the scheme for redevelopment of this important site. It is understandable that the Mayor wishes further to examine it in the context of his strategic planning policies for London and we look forward to further dialogue with him."

At this time of challenge and uncertainty across all areas of our economy we believe he has the management skills and creative flair to broaden the appeal of Strawberry Hill House & Garden as it enters the next phase in its long history."

Derek Purnell, who starts at Strawberry Hill House on July 13<sup>th</sup>, said today: "The restoration of Strawberry Hill House & Garden over the past decade is a story of outstanding vison and success, backed by an indefatigable army of supporters. I am very excited at this opportunity to build further the reputation and appeal of Strawberry Hill House across the many communities of South West London, and beyond. I look forward to working with the Board of Trustees, the in-House team and volunteers to achieve even greater success in the future."

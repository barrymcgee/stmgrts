The public toilets at the Old Town Hall in Richmond have reopened following their temporary closure due to Covid-19.

Since the start of the pandemic, the toilets on Whittaker Avenue have been closed. Over the past few weeks, the facilities have been deep cleaned and are now able to be opened to the public.

Whilst signage and information is on display at the facility, users are reminded to take responsibility for their own safety whilst using them - washing their hands, keeping their distance from others.

The toilets are open Monday to Friday from 10am - 4pm and will be shortly open on Saturdays when the Reference Library opening hours are extended.

Cllr Julia Neden-Watts, Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee for Richmond Council, said:

> "Ensuring we provide a welcoming environment for shoppers is fundamental to rebuilding the High Street and we recognise the role that clean and accessible public toilets have to play. Therefore, we're delighted to offer this additional toilet facility to visitors and shoppers which will complement the existing facilities in cafes, pubs, shops and, of course, at Richmond Railway Station."

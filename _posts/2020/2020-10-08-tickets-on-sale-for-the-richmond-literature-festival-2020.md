The programme takes places throughout November and includes talks by authors, historians, politicians, poets and more, with writing workshops, as well as activities for children and families.

The full programme of events can be found at [www.richmondliterature.com.](http://www.richmondliterature.com). You can [book online or by phone](http://www.richmondliterature.com/how-to-book.html).

The organisers are working hard to ensure the safety of visitors and staff. To comply with COVID-19 venue guidelines, less tickets will be on sale this year and a digital programme is available for those who are shielding. Please note that arrangements are subject to change with government COVID-19 guidance and the programme may become fully digital if the need arises. [A list of measures taken](http://www.richmondliterature.com/covid-19.html).

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Culture for Richmond Council, said:

> "We are all really pleased that this year's Literature Festival is going ahead. Although some events may be online, it's still a cracking line up of interesting literary marvels!

> "Reading has been a great comfort to lots of us this year. It has helped people feel less isolated, helped children continue to learn whilst schools were closed and provided everyone with a source of escapism.

> "So, join us this Literature Festival to celebrate the power of literature!"

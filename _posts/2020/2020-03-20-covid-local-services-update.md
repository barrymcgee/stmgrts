London is starting to shutdown to attempt to suppress Covid-19 transmission.  This includes the shutdown of all cafes, pubs and restaurants, except for take-aways. Here is the list of changes to local services.

#### Trains

South West Trains are reducing the number of services running from Monday 23 March, following the Government's announcement urging people to avoid all but essential travel in order to help limit the spread of the highly contagious virus.

Some alterations to services will continue in the meantime due to last minute cancellations from staff being unavailable, before the [amended timetable](https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/coronvirus-temporary-timetable) is introduced on Monday.

For the latest travel information, please visit: [southwesternrailway.com/amended-timetable](https://www.southwesternrailway.com/amended-timetable)

#### Tubes

Due to the Covid-19 virus, the following service changes will be in place until further notice:

- No Waterloo & City line service,
- No Night Tube or Night Overground service,

From Monday 23 March, a reduced service will operate on all London Underground, London Overground, DLR, TfL Rail and London Trams.

Some stations will be closed.  Please only travel if essential. Check [tfl.gov.uk](https://tfl.gov.uk) for the latest information.

#### Arts and culture

Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham and the Riverside Gallery in Richmond are closed to the public.

#### Care homes, vulnerable and older people

Our health and adult social care services department have been working in partnership with care providers across the borough to ensure that relevant steps are being taken to minimise the risks of the virus for both staff and residents.

#### Children's Centres and Youth Centres

From Monday 23 March we will no longer be delivering any open public sessions in our Children's Centres and Youth Centres. Should you require any support please visit the Local Offer website where information on a range of support services is available.

#### Council civic buildings

Receptions at the Civic Centre and 42 York Street (Children's Services) will remain open. However, please only attend in person if absolutely necessary. Residents should contact the Council online or by phone. York House reception is now closed.

#### Events/Council venue hire

Following the Government guidance regarding stopping all social gatherings and encouraging social distancing, all public events held on Council premises or property will unfortunately be cancelled or postponed.

#### Sports Centres

The borough's sports centres, including Pools on the Park, are closed.

#### Libraries

The borough's libraries are closed to the public until further notice.

The Home Delivery service will still be available for existing users although a slight revision to delivery and collection arrangements will be required. Full online and e-book services will continue. Information on how to access online services, book returns, renewals and reservations will be available on the library webpage.

#### Register Office services

In addition, and as the Government guidance is clear regarding avoiding groups of people, we are also unfortunately required to cancel a number of weddings at our Register Office and those conducted at licensed venues across the borough, including York House.

Non-essential face to face appointments to register births and take notices of marriage or civil partnership will also be postponed. Deaths and stillbirths will continue to be registered, where safe to do so. If there are no available informants to register a death due to self-isolation, contraction or exposure to the virus please contact our office for advice. Please do not attend without an appointment.

#### Schools

Schools in the borough are identifying children of keyworkers and vulnerable children, such as those with Education, Health and Care Plans and those who have social worker support. Schools will provide education on site for those children for the last two weeks of this term, and some provision during the Easter holidays period.

#### Transport and parking

The Council and Transport for London (TfL) are making a number of changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To support this please avoid all but essential travel. Read the latest information regarding transport and parking.

#### Waste and recycling services

There are currently no changes to our waste and recycling and street cleansing services.

If you are displaying symptoms, personal waste (such as used tissues) and disposable cleaning cloths can be stored securely within disposable rubbish bags.  These bags should be placed into another bag, tied securely and kept separate from other waste within your own room. This should be put aside for at least 72 hours before being put in your usual external household waste bin including communal bins. Please do not put used/unused paper tissues in your blue box.

Other household waste can be disposed of as normal.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, the Leader of Richmond Council, will be answering the public's questions regarding the Council's response to the Corona Virus pandemic next week.

On Tuesday 31 March at 3pm, via the [Council's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/lbrut), Cllr Roberts will be live on video, providing information and answering questions on areas such as the new Community Hub which supports vulnerable residents, changes to local service provision and what residents and businesses can do to help.

Watch live online from 3-4pm on Tuesday. If you are unable to take part, residents can submit their questions in advance to:  [events@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:events@richmond.gov.uk)

Cllr Gareth Roberts, said:

> "This is the biggest emergency that our country has ever faced. It is all hands-on deck. The Government has had to make some critical decisions about the way we live in order to prevent the spread of this horrific virus.

> "It is on each and every one of us to make sacrifices to ensure that we can limit the number of people who get ill or die. It is simple.

> "As a Council we are following the Government's guidance and instruction on how to restrict our non-essential services and ensure we comply with social distancing. This has resulted in changes to a number of our services.

> "We know that people have lots of questions. Whilst I can't promise to know the answers to all of them - I can try. So, next Tuesday, log onto the Council's Facebook and I will try to respond to what I do know."

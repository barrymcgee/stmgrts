Do you know a tech obsessed young person who would be interested in learning about coding? CoderDojo is a fun and relaxed computer programming club that is hosting a special hackathon in Richmond on Saturday 1 February.

Richmond CoderDojo is taking part in the national BBC 'do your :bit' challenge, a micro:bit challenge that works towards finding solutions to global goals. This CoderDojo session will teach young people how a BBC micro:bit can be used to help protect the environment!

Micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer given to every year 7 child in the UK for free to inspire digital creativity and develop a new generation of tech pioneers.

The event will run from 11.30am - 3.30pm at Whittaker Ellis Suite, Old Town Hall, Whittaker Avenue, Richmond, TW9 1TP. It is free to attend but booking is essential. To book a space email  [libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:libraryvolunteer@richmond.gov.uk).

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "With the UK facing a skills shortage in the technology sector, it is really important that young people are well equipped with tech literacy skills.

> "Initiatives like CoderDojo are great ways to introduce and encourage creativity through technology.

> "The BBC micro:bit is a codeable computer with motion detection, a built-in compass and Bluetooth technology , and whilst that may sound overwhelming to many of us, it is designed to be fun and easy to use! So, encourage anyone you know that might be interested to go along and give coding a go"

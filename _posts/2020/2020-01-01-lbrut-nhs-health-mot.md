Are you over 40 years old? Did you know you are entitled to a free NHS Health Check every five years? Why not kick start 2020 by having your Health Check, helping you to enjoy life for longer!

The NHS Health Check is a health check-up for adults in England. It's designed to spot early signs of stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or dementia.

To be eligible for a free NHS Health Check, you must be aged 40-74, be a Richmond upon Thames resident or register to a GP in Richmond, have not been previously diagnosed with diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease or stroke and do not take statins.

In the last six months of 2019, around 5,662 residents were invited by their GP (by letter, text and phone) to have a health check. However, only 47% (2,669) residents did take up the offer.

This year, we want even more people to take stock of their health and go and have a free health check.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health and Housing Committee, said:

> "This is the season of making resolutions. And I, like many residents, will be thinking about my health and what changes I can make to help me live well for longer.

> "Even if you feel great like me, being over forty means your health risks are higher. Knowing what those risks are means you can make changes to your lifestyle to delay or avoid the onset of these diseases."

> "My New Year message to all residents is to take greater responsibility for your health. There is lots of support available to help make live changes, and a health check is a good first step. Eligible residents may receive a Health Check invitation from their GP. They can also contact their GP to find out when their Health Check is due."

Dr Graham Lewis, local GP and Chair of NHS Richmond Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), added:

> "The NHS Health Check is an opportunity for people to improve their health and become more aware of what they can do to lead a healthier life. It can also help identify those at risk of serious, but potentially avoidable conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

> "If needed, it provides an opportunity for people make preventative lifestyle changes to lower the risk of developing health conditions later in life. Speak to your GP practice for more information."

Visit our website or contact your GP to find out if you are eligible for a NHS Health Check or if you have one before  when your next health check is due. Health checks are also offered at C Goode Pharmacy in King Street, Twickenham and Kanset Pharmacy in Ashburnham Road, Richmond.

Calling local Francophiles looking to improve or perfect their French. I have been running friendly French conversation classes in Richmond since 2012.

Due to current circumstances, we have moved everything online, and have been chatting and cheering each other up in French from the comfort of our homes, using an easy user-friendly system with Zoom.  Due to popular demand I have built up to 5 regular groups, who choose to look at current affairs, literature, grammar, or a mixture, all in increasingly confident French! N'oubliez pas la conversation g&#233;n&#233;rale en fran&#231;ais et l'ambiance conviviale entre amis!

If you'd like to join a current group (every morning Mon - Fri) space-permitting and/ or create a new group, please see my contact details and website below.

Bon courage et &#224; bient&#244;t,

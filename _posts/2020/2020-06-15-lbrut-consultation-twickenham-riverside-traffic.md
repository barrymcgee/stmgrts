A consultation outlining the Council's proposals on how it will make part of Twickenham Riverside car free - has been launched.

Last year, following feedback from residents, the Council ran a Design Competition to find a new architect and concept design for the site, a site that includes the stretch of The Embankment between Wharf Lane and Water Lane which is to be closed to all vehicular traffic to make the most of the riverside setting.

To enable this to happen, a full review of parking provision in the area has been carried out, assessing the demand for parking. Therefore, today the Council has launched a consultation that outlines the plans to remove approximately 82 parking spaces from The Embankment area, which will be balanced through a series of measures which we would like residents and businesses to have their say on.

Although parking spaces will be removed from The Embankment itself, proposals ensure that access and servicing requirements for Eel Pie Island and nearby properties are incorporated into the new scheme, as well as the provision of accessible spaces and electric vehicle charging points.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Services Committee, said:

> "Over the past few years there has been a big community-led campaign to put the public realm to better community use on Twickenham Riverside by removing the parking. We have listened.

> "We have done a lot of research and studies to understand how the area is currently used. We have used this information to create a series of proposals that maintain access and parking in the nearby area for those who need it - but also looks to the future.  A future where residents increasingly choose sustainable transport options, including cycling and walking."

To have your say, go to:  [haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/environment/twickrside20](https://haveyoursay.citizenspace.com/environment/twickrside20 )  The deadline for feedback is: Sunday 12 July 2020.

#### Summary of parking proposals

The proposals are summarised as follows:

- The change in designation of approximately 93 on-street parking spaces, 62 of which are within 250m of the site with priority given to permit holders (including residents)
- The creation of approximately 34 new on-street parking spaces within 800m of the site, nine of which are within 400m of the site
- The introduction of an entitlement to allow Zone D business parking permit holders to park in the Holly Road car park, currently only those who pay the daily charge or those who have a valid Zone D resident parking permit may park in this car park.
- The implementation of new double yellow lines, many of which will be at junctions, to improve road safety conditions in the area

The servicing and access proposals are summarised as follows:

- A reconfiguration of the road layout in Water Lane which involves linking the service road between Water Lane and Wharf Lane (along the rear of Nos 3-33 King Street)
- A two-way working of the southern sections of both Water Lane and Wharf Lane to enable access and egress for all vehicles
- Provision of servicing areas (that is, for loading/unloading) in the area, including near to the Eel Pie Island footbridge

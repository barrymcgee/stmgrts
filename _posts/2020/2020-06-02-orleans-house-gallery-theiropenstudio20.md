Orleans House Gallery is encouraging young artists from across the borough to showcase artwork to be in with a chance of winning fantastic prizes.

Entries to this year's #TheirOpenStudios20 competition are now open to school and college art & design students in years 7-13. The Art House Open Studio Festival and Star Print Twickenham have launched the competition to showcase artwork from the 2019-20 academic year. The prizes include art supplies, vouchers and window space at Star Print Twickenham

It's the second year that the Council has run the competition after it was launched in 2019 to complement the Art House Open Studio summer festival. The 2020 festival has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Arts Service is encouraging young artists to share their work as part of the online programme that has been developed in response to the closure of galleries and cancellation of exhibitions.

Entries to the competition can be submitted by posting a picture of the chosen artwork from a schools Instagram, Facebook or Twitter account and by using the hashtag `#TheirOpenStudio20` `#ArtHouse20` and tagging [@orleanshousegallery](https://twitter.com/orleanshousegallery)

Cllr John Coombs, Richmond Council's Spokesperson for Arts, said:

> "I would encourage all art and design students to put forward work that makes them feel proud. The competition is a fantastic way to showcase the array of young local artistic talent.

> "The Richmond Art House Open Studio Festival is one of the highlights the year in our borough and, while this year's event has unfortunately been cancelled, I am pleased that the Council is able to continue to support local artists through this difficult period and to help showcase their work through innovative digital means."

The closing date for entries is June 28 with the winners set to be announced in early July.

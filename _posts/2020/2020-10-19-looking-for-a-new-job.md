Are you a Richmond resident looking for work? Perhaps looking for a new start, a career change, a first job or returning to the work-place? If so, why not contact Work Match?

Richmond Work Match has been launched by Richmond Council and aims to find jobs, apprenticeships and training roles for people in the borough.

A team of recruitment specialists work with businesses across Richmond upon Thames that are recruiting now, securing exclusive jobs for local residents.

The service is only available to people living in the area who are out of work. Candidates who sign up are given help writing CVs, interview skills and given any required training.

Cllr Richard Baker, Spokesperson for Economics and Business for Richmond Council, said:

> "As the borough gets back on its feet, many people may be finding that they need to find a new job closer to home or they are uncertain which direction to take after recently becoming redundant.

> "The expert team at Work Match will provide trusted advice and help with your CV, training or simply confidence-building so that you are ready for the right opportunity when it comes up. If you are a local employer that urgently needs to recruit skilled candidates who are ready for work, do get in touch with Work Match to get the best chance at success."

Local businesses who are looking for new employees are also invited to get in touch. Work Match is a free, bespoke service that aims to develop a personal knowledge of each business prior to advertising vacancies. The team also pre-screen candidates before submitting them to ensure that the exact criteria is met.

The service works closely with Job Centre Plus, community organisations, local colleges and schools to provide an integrated support network.

In line with current Government guidance on the safe reopening of public buildings, Richmond upon Thames Library Service will begin a phased reopening from Monday 6 July 2020, starting with the resumption of the popular 'click and collect' service for library books. Please note that dates are, of course, subject to any further updates from Government.

#### Click and Collect

From Monday 6 July the 'click and collect' service will be resumed for reserved books only from selected Richmond upon Thames Libraries.

If you would like to use this service then please visit the [online library catalogue](https://richmond.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/HOME) to make your reservation/s and then come to your selected pick up library when you are notified your reservation/s is ready to collect.

Please be aware that social distancing measures will be in place at the library and you may have to queue outside the library to collect your reservations. Following official advice, all returned books are being quarantined for 72hrs before being put back on shelves / going out to readers again.

Libraries that will be available for the Click and Collect service are:

- **Hampton Hill Library** - 68 High Street, TW12 1NY
Mon - Sat* 11am to 2pm (*closed Tuesdays)
- **Richmond Lending Library** - Little Green, TW9 1QL
Mon - Sat 11am to 2pm
- **Teddington Library** - Waldegrave Road, TW11 8NY
Mon - Sat 11am to 2pm
- **Twickenham Library** - Garfield Road, TW1 3JT
Mon - Sat 11am to 2pm
- **Whitton Library** - 141 Nelson Road, TW2 7BB
Mon - Sat 11am to 2pm

Other libraries will be added at a later date as part of the phased reopening plan.

Customers with reservations already in the system will be contacted by staff.

If you are unable to use the online reservation system, you can telephone the library service and staff will place your reservations for you. Please telephone 020 8734 3330, lines are open between 10am-4pm Monday to Saturday.

#### Reopening

Further steps in the phased reopening plan will be implemented in the coming weeks. More library buildings will gradually be added to the click and collect locations and more services will steadily become available during the coming months. Please check the [library website](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/libraries) and follow [library social media](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/services/libraries/libraries_keep_up_to_date) to stay up to date with developments.

#### Current loans

To help our customers, all library resources that were on loan when we entered lockdown have been extended and are not now due back until 1 September. If you wish to return materials earlier then you can do so via the usual library bookdrops. Staff will be collecting and quarantining returned books at regular intervals so please be aware it may take a few days for dropbox returns to be checked in.

#### eLibraries

If you are unable to visit the library there is a [full electronic library service available](https://www.richmond.gov.uk/digital_library), including eBooks, eAudiobooks, eMagazines and eNewspapers from around the world.

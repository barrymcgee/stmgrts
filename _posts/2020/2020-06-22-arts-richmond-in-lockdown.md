    When the lockdown happened in March, we were dismayed and disappointed that so many arts related activities planned for this spring and summer had to be cancelled or postponed.  So many of our affiliated societies from all fields of the arts have their busiest schedules of performances, exhibitions, visits and visitors over this period.

When the lockdown happened in March, we were dismayed and disappointed that so many arts related activities planned for this spring and summer had to be cancelled or postponed.  So many of our affiliated societies from all fields of the arts have their busiest schedules of performances, exhibitions, visits and visitors over this period.

However, our resourceful Arts Richmond team, quickly adapted to the new normal. [Our newsletter](http://www.artsrichmond.org.uk/docs/newsletter/JulyNewsletter.pdf) continues to be produced monthly and has found new and engaging ways of supporting our affiliates and entertaining our members. New features on our website include an 'Artist of the Week', a weekly creative challenge, an exciting, growing poetry section and the Howard Greenwood Music Corner!

We are keen to support all those people who have found lockdown time to develop their creative skills and interests and hope we have plenty of challenges for them! We hope also that for those experiencing loneliness and worry we are able to offer direct support by keeping in touch and offering information about the enormous range of arts related activities still available. Our newsletter has it all so do check it out on our website and perhaps consider becoming a member of Arts Richmond so that you can hear from us directly!

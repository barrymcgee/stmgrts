Pedal Up is a group of six experienced cycle instructors who are qualified to deliver cycle training to the National Standard. We are all passionate about cycling and have worked for Richmond council delivering training across the borough to schools and to cyclists of all ages on a 1 to 1 basis.

With the very welcome increase in cycling over recent months, we decided to set up a cycle training enterprise that would help cyclists plan get back on the road with confidence. We offer tailored 1 to 1 sessions for all ages within the Richmond borough and surrounding areas and can help cyclists plan their route to work or school, then cycle it with them.

We are also offering summer courses for children who may have missed out on their Year 6 training due to lockdown or who just want a bit of a refresher in order to cycle to school in September. For further information, have a look at our flyers or call us on 07988 160 114 or email us  [hello@pedalup.co.uk](mailto:hello@pedalup.co.uk) and we'll be happy to help.

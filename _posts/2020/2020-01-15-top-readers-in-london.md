Richmond libraries have come out top in London in the UK's annual library survey, showing the local people are some of the most avid readers in the capital.

The survey, conducted by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, (CIPFA) aims to understand library service usership and investment across the country.

For the most recent annual figures (2018/19), Richmond upon Thames libraries have come out top in London for several categories including:

- Number of book issues per 1000 population - 1<sup>st</sup> in London
- Number of reservations supplied within 7 days - 1<sup>st</sup> in London
- Number of requests for specific items - 1<sup>st</sup> in London
- Number of online requests - 1<sup>st</sup> in London
- Number of requests per 1000 population - 1<sup>st</sup> in London

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries at Richmond Council, said:

> "This is great news! We know that our libraries are well used by local people. Last year we loaned over 1 million books to local people and welcomed over 1,374,000 visitors.

> "Making sure that libraries are relevant and current is very important and library staff work hard to ensure that a wide range of books and eBooks are always on offer and that local people can get easy access to the things they want to read.

> "Despite huge cuts in Government funding and with libraries across the country being closed to help save the public purse, we are investing in our local library network, ensuring our libraries provide a wide range of relevant services and that they remain a vital part of each local community'

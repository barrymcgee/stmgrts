Turner's House Trust are delighted to announce the reopening of Turner's House (Sandycombe Lodge) to the public from Thursday 6<sup>th</sup> August 2020 following four months of closure due to the Coronavirus.

This idyllic picturesque house, designed by the seminal landscape artist, Joseph Mallord William Turner (with advice from his friend the leading architect Sir John Soane) and used by the artist as a country retreat, will initially open its doors for three days a week, and following government guidance on social distancing, will allow up to eight visitors per hour to view this small Georgian villa.

House Director Ricky Pound commented: "I am incredibly grateful to the National Lottery Heritage Fund and its players for providing Turner's House with an Emergency Fund grant that has enabled the house to reopen once again. This historic house, like many other visitor attractions and museums, has suffered large financial losses during recent months and these funds have been pivotal in preparation for reopening".

The house will open to the public with full precautions in place against the Coronavirus, and having fewer visitors in the house at any one time will allow for an even more intimate experience.  Another bonus for visitors to the house is the extension of the popular and previously sold out Turner and the Thames: Five Paintings exhibition which was originally due to end on 30<sup>th</sup> April but has now been extended until Saturday 31<sup>st</sup> October.

Turner's House Trust are incredibly grateful to the Tate Gallery for the loan of these five original Turner oil sketches, the first original Turner works to be shown in the house since 1826. The exhibition was opened by Sir David Attenborough on Friday 10<sup>th</sup> January and sold out within three weeks. The extension of the exhibition will allow a larger audience to view these wonderfully atmospheric oil sketches. The exhibition has been made possible through The Ferryman Project: Sharing Works of Art which is supported by National Lottery players through The National Lottery Heritage Fund, the John Ellerman Foundation and the Art Fund as well as two local sponsors Gentle Mathias Solicitors and Cantell & Co.

Turner's House will operate a reduced opening schedule of Thursday to Saturday for the present. The house will open on those days from 12pm to 4pm.  Advance booking for all visits to Turner's House is now compulsory. For general information and to book your visit please go to [www.Turnerhouse.org](http://www.Turnerhouse.org)

Exclusive guided tours for small family groups and close friends can also be arranged. Please contact  [housedirector@turnershouse.org](mailto:housedirector@turnershouse.org) for further details.

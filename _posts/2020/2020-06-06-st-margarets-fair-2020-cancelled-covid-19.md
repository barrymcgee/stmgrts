The St Margarets Fair Committee regrets to inform you that due to the situation surrounded Covid-19 we are cancelling the fair previously scheduled for 4 July 2020. If circumstances allow, we will try to organise an event later in the year.

Any stallholders that have already booked a space will be contacted directly by a committee member and will receive refunds.

For the past 41 years the St Margarets Fair has raised large sums of money to support local schools and charities as well as the St Margarets Senior Citizen Christmas Dinner held annually in December. Without your support we may not be able to run this much-loved event in 2020.

The fair in 2021 is likely to be on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of July so please reserve this date and we hope to see you then if we are unable to organise anything later this year.

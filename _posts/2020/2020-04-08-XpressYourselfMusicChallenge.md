Young people aged 10 to 19 are encouraged to take part in a music challenge hosted by Project X for Achieving for Children. The winner will receive a &pound;50 voucher!

The #XpressYourselfMusicChallenge will run for four weeks with each week being a different challenge. Three winners will be selected each week and will then compete in the final week (week four) for a chance to be crowned the #XpressYourselfMusicChallenge champion and win the voucher.

Week one's challenge is to create a rap along to [this backing track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_clqnNiaw&feature=youtu.be), which must include the following four words:

- Coronavirus
- Self-isolation
- Social distancing
- Lockdown

You must reside, be educated or work in either Richmond upon Thames or Kingston upon Thames to enter.

Week one's competition closes on Tuesday 14 April at 12.00pm. The rap must be no longer than 60 seconds and cannot include any profanities or ism's (sexism, racism, etc.).

To enter the competition and share your rap, please copy and paste the below statement and send the statement along with your audio or video clip to Achieving for Children either by direct message on Instagram (@afc_project_x) or by email to  [dwayne.wright@achievingforchildren.org.uk](mailto:dwayne.wright@achievingforchildren.org.uk).  Please also include your rap name and Instagram handle.

Statement: I agree for my name, audio, and Instagram handle to be uploaded and used by achieving for children / project X as part of the publicity and promotion and for the duration of the competition.

Cllr Penny Frost, Chair of the Education and Children's Services Committee at Richmond Council, said:

> "This is a fun and creative challenge for young people to get stuck into whilst staying at home and saving lives during the current coronavirus pandemic.

> "Best of luck to everyone that takes part!"

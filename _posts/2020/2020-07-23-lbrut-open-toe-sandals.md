The Arts Society Richmond have a range of online Lectures, Study Days and Virtual Walks for the enjoyment of members and non-members.

Richmond say they have been quick to embrace new technology in response to Covid and whilst venues may have been closed a full programme has continued virtually.

Coming up are talks about Delftware Apothecary Jars, London Underground Design, the History of Tailoring and Punch and Judy.  Online Visits will include The London Skyline, Highlights of the British Museum and the Queen's Jewellery Collection.

There have been recent Zoom lectures on Tintoretto, Beethoven and Picasso and virtual walks around the East End of London and Fulham and Chelsea.

The talks last for one hour with a chance to ask questions at the end.  All are given by accredited lecturers.  Lectures are free to members and visits cost a nominal amount (&pound;5-&pound;10).

Said Chair Jenny Lebus: "Once we all realised we were in it for the long haul with Covid we looked at every which way to keep our members engaged with the arts.  We had brilliant support from our HQ and we have all learnt more than we ever thought possible in a very short space of time.

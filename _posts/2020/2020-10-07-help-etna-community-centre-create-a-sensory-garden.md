Help ETNA Community Centre create a Sensory Garden

Help us to create a Sensory Garden for Twickenham by purchasing a fabulous, limited edition photographic montage entitled 'Aspects of Twickenham' by professional photographer Emma Durnford.

- A new sensory planting scheme based on sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight
- New curved bench seating to create relaxing and sociable spaces
- Improved biodiversity
- A calm space for all to enjoy
- Arboreal tree designed areas
- Bicycle racks

By buying this beautiful artwork, which is comprised of 25 images of Twickenham, you will help us reach our goal. Each montage measures 40cm x 40cm and is mounted to 50cm x 50cm.  They are individually numbered, signed, and come with a guide to the locations of the images.  The cost is &pound;100 with 30% going directly to ETNA's Sensory Garden appeal. The print can also be supplied framed for &pound;135.

The history and enduring appeal of the Ladderback chair.

There is at 7 Hammersmith Terrace, once the home of Emery Walker, Victorian photographer and legendary printer, a Ladderback chair. However, as you can discover at an online talk on Wednesday 2<sup>nd</sup> December, this is no ordinary chair.

The Ladderback and its maker, Philip Clissett, came to symbolise an idealised past that pre-dated the dehumanised production lines of the industrial revolution. But could this iconic part of British design history have been made by a bodger?

Linked to the chair, to Clissett and to the Cotswold craftsmen of Pinbury and Sapperton, was the romantic notion that this chair could be made in a single day from scratch, from the chopping down of the ash tree to completing the complex woven willow seat. The person capable of such a feat was, so the narrative went, someone known as a 'bodger'.

Philip Clissett was born in Birtsmorton, Worcestershire into a long line of chairmakers dating back to the mid-1750s. By continuing to work with the ancient tools of the craft such as pole lathes, axes, saws, adzes and a spoke shave-like drawknife, Clissett embodied this rose-tinted vision of a past without organised and mechanised labour.

Various members of the Arts & Crafts Movement set out to learn how to make this iconic chair, notably, the architect, designer and Arts & Crafts purist, Ernest Gimson.

Gavin Shreeve, a volunteer guide from Emery Walker's House will explain how it is one of many fine artefacts in the house made by Cotswold-based members of the Arts & Crafts movement who aimed to emulate the life and work practises of medieval peasant communities.

This live, interactive talk is part of a programme of monthly events via Zoom. Please prebook via [Emerywalker.org.uk](https://Emerywalker.org.uk).

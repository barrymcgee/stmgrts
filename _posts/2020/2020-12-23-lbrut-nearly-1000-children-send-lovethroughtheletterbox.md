A big thank you to the 950 children and young people who spread festive spirit in care homes around the borough - by creating Christmas cards and letters.

Over the past three weeks, Richmond Council appealed to children and young people to help spread Christmas joy by creating and writing Christmas cards for care home residents in the borough - local people who have been some of the most affected by COVID-19.

Hundreds of children and their families created beautiful cards and messages. These have now been sent on to 13 residential care homes across the borough, to be distributed amongst their residents.

This follows a letter writing campaign earlier in the year, where over 450 children sent goodwill messages to older residents during the first lockdown.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health & Housing Committee and the Richmond Health & Wellbeing Board, said:

> "WOW! I am so thrilled that so many of our children have spent the time to create such heart felt Christmas cards. Those that live in our care homes really have had a tough time this year. Many have not seen their families or loved ones for months. And this will be particularly difficult at Christmas. I know that these seasonal cards will bring goodwill and cheer and show older people that the whole borough is thinking of them."

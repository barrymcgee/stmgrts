Don't lose your voice - residents in Richmond upon Thames are urged to look out for their voter registration details from the Council.

Local residents are being encouraged to ensure that they do not to lose their voice on decisions that affect them by making sure their electoral registration details are up to date.

With elections taking place in London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in May 2021, this is an important opportunity for residents to make sure they can take part.

The annual canvass ensures that the Richmond Council can keep the electoral register up to date, identifying any residents who are not registered so that they can be encouraged to do so. They would then be able take part in any future elections.

Mark Maidment, Electoral Registration Officer at the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames said:

> "It's important that residents keep an eye out for messages from the Council so we can make sure we have the right details on the electoral register for every address in the borough. To make sure you are able to have your say at the Mayor of London and Assembly elections taking place next year, simply follow the instructions from the Council's electoral services team.

> "If you're not currently registered, your name will not appear in the messages we send. If you want to register, the easiest way is online at [www.gov.uk/register-to-vote,](http://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote, )or we'll send you information explaining how to do this in the post.

> "This year's canvass, which we have to carry out by law, is taking place during a challenging public health situation. We are working to ensure that we take account of public health guidelines, including the continued importance of social distancing."

The 2020 canvass will run from 1 July 2020 in England and Wales, and from 3 August 2020 in Scotland. Electoral registration Officers are required to do this by law. It has not been suspended as a result of COVID-19.

When you are contacted, if you need to make a change to your registration information, please respond as soon as possible. It will make sure the process runs smoothly. It also means there will be no need for additional contact, which is particularly important now.

People who have moved recently are particularly encouraged to look out for the voter registration messages from the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and check the details.

Research by the Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long time. Across Great Britain, 92% of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to 36% of people who have lived at an address for less than one year.

Melanie Davidson, Head of Support and Improvement at the Electoral Commission, said:

> "It's really important that everyone who is entitled to vote is able to do so. Making sure you provide the necessary information to your local authority when it is needed will ensure the process runs smoothly. This is particularly helpful in the current public health situation, as it will help avoid the need for home visits from canvassers.

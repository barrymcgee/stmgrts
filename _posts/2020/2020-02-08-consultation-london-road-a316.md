Transport for London (TfL) would like to know what you think about their proposals to improve walking and cycling at the A316 London Road roundabout in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

This programme directly contributes to the Vision Zero target to eliminate deaths and serious injuries from London's roads by 2041. It will also contribute to the target that 80 per cent of all London trips being made by foot, bicycle or public transport by 2041, up from 64 per cent today.

### What we are proposing

The proposed changes include:

- Alterations to the shape of the roundabout as well as resurfacing, to improve safety and facilitate new crossing facilities
- Taking space from the centre of the roundabout (which is not accessible to the public) to increase the number of traffic lanes to improve safety and allow better lane discipline
- Provision of new signal controlled pedestrian and cycle crossing facilities (Toucans) on the north, west and south arms of the roundabout
- Provision of a new signal controlled Toucan crossing facility at Cole Park Road
- Reshaping / relocating or removing existing uncontrolled crossings/pedestrian refuges
- Kerb realignment on southern side of roundabout to cater for foot path widening and resurfacing, including refreshed landscaping
- Appropriate drainage provision
- A review of street lighting

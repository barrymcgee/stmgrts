Young people over the age of 12 are invited to get creative and learn how a novel is turned into a stage production on Wednesday 26 February at Richmond Library Annexe from 7pm.

Richmond Theatre, in partnership with Richmond Libraries, will be leading the workshop ahead of its page-to-stage show of The Kite Runner that runs for five nights in the beginning of March.

The Kite Runner is a critically acclaimed and international bestselling book by author Khaled Hosseini. Set in Afghanistan, the book tells a gripping and emotional story of betrayal and redemption between friends.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "Richmond Theatre welcomes a quarter of a million theatre goers ever year and is one of the most successful theatres in the country - making this a really great opportunity for a behind the scenes glimpse into theatre production!"

[Booking is essential](https://www2.richmond.gov.uk/Richmondbookings/Details.aspx?Id=54803). Please do not book tickets for accompanying adults.

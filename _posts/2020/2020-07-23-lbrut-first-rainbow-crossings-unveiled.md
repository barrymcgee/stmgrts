Two rainbow crossings have been unveiled in the borough, as the Council shows its support for the borough's LGBTQ  community.

The new Rainbow crossings were installed on Tuesday (21 July) and Wednesday nights (22 July) in two high profile locations: outside Richmond Station and on King Street in Twickenham.

The crossings feature the colours of the internationally recognised Pride Flag which has come to symbolise diversity and pride of the LGBTQ  community worldwide.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Services Committee, at Richmond Council, said:

> "Here in Richmond we are hugely proud to show our support for the LGBTQ  community.

> "Our borough has a long history of supporting diversity and equality, so I'm delighted to be able to announce our first rainbow crossings.

> "We want all our residents and communities to know that we are here with them, we support them, and we are working hard to make sure our borough is a place where people feel safe, free from discrimination and proud to be themselves."

Sophie Robbins, Chair of the South-West London LGBT  Support Group, said:

> "The rainbow crossings couldn't have come at a better time for the LGBTQ  community in the borough and beyond. Unfortunately, we're seeing big rises in homophobic, biphobic and transphobic hate.

> "They're a beautiful, bright public statement of the tolerant society of friendship and mutual respect we all want to see. I would encourage other councils in south-west London and elsewhere to follow Richmond's example."

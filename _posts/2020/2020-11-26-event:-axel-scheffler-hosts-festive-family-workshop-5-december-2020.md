*Habitats & Heritage*, the new charity dedicated to conserving and developing the natural and historic environment of south and west London, is kick-starting the Christmas season with an exclusive, online family workshop hosted by the world-famous illustrator of The Gruffalo, Axel Scheffler.

This unique online event that will delight, inspire and enthral all ages will take place at 11 am on Saturday, 5<sup>th</sup> December online and will last about 30 minutes. The cost of a family ticket is &pound;10 (plus a small booking fee).

During the event, Axel will bring to life some of the nation's favourite children's book characters in this drawing extravaganza. The audience will be invited to get involved and draw their own versions of The Gruffalo, Stickman, and Snail and the Whale at the same time, to add to the festive spirit. Axel will also read some choice excerpts from the much-loved books he helped create with Julia Donaldson. This will be followed by a lively Q&A session.

Beautiful, limited edition signed prints of the Winter Deer illustration by Axel will be available for purchase before the event.

Axel Scheffler said, "I'm looking forward to welcoming families to this festive virtual workshop. It's going to be really enjoyable for everyone, as we throw ourselves into the creative process and produce some wonderful illustrations. I'm happy to support the important work of Habitats & Heritage in this way."

Colin Cooper, CEO of Habitats & Heritage, stated, "We're extremely fortunate Axel is such a committed supporter and active patron of our charity. His workshop will be a big hit with families looking for creative ways to get into the Christmas spirit. While Axel brings the magic of the nation's favourite children's book characters into people's homes, Habitats & Heritage will take care of the magic outside.

We encourage everyone to go out and explore the nature and heritage in their local areas. The role this plays in well-being for both the environment and the community cannot be underestimated, particularly during these challenging times. It is in this spirit that we have also launched a photography competition to source a photo that best celebrates the local habitats and heritage of south and west London. People enter their favourite picture(s) free-of-charge and the winning photo will find a proud home on our new website. Watch this space for news of more exciting initiatives over the coming months. There's a lot in the pipeline..." he continued.

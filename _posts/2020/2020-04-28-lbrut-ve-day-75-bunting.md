Residents are encouraged to create Great British Bunting to display in windows at home to help commemorate the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of war in Europe.

Known as VE Day - or Victory in Europe Day - the commemoration falls on Friday 8 May 2020 and is when Nazi Germany surrendered and guns fell silent in Europe during the Second World War.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, VE Day 75 events and street parties have been cancelled or postponed whilst we stay home and save lives.

However, the BBC is encouraging the nation to mark the occasion and honour the men and women of WW2 by creating bunting for your household.

In a similar manner to how households in the borough have been decorating windows with #RichmondRainbows to say thank you to key workers and to help spread positivity, the #GreatBritishBunting project is a creative way to show that we will never forget the brave men and women of World War Two.

Hang your bunting with pride over the weekend Friday 8 May - Sunday 10 May and share your pictures on social media using the hashtags #GreatBritishBunting and #RichmondVEDay.

Cllr Nancy Baldwin, Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, said:

> "Sadly, the planned events to mark the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of VE day can't happen but the Great British Bunting project shows that there are still ways we can mark the occasion from home.

> "It's a great opportunity to get creative with the family whilst staying home and staying safe. So let your imagination run free!  Make bunting, fly flags or decorate your house red, white and blue!

> "The #RichmondRainbows project saw just how creative the borough can be so I'm looking forward to the long weekend and seeing the VE Day tributes light up social media!"

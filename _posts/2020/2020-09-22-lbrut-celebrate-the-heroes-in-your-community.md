Do you know inspirational individual, group, or business who deserves recognition for the work they have done in their community? Well we want you to tell us about them!

Nominations for 2020's Community Heroes Awards open today. It's a chance for us to highlight and celebrate the commitment of the people and groups living and working in Richmond upon Thames, who improve the lives of our communities and represent the borough through their commitment to others and excellence in what they do.

It might be a young person who has led their peers through being a good example, someone who supports the elderly in their community or a group who helps look after their local park.

Nominations can be made for work directly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other work not directly linked to the pandemic, but all work must have been carried out in a voluntary capacity.

Awards will once again be offered in specific categories, to reflect the breadth of voluntary work being done in communities.

Cllr Michael Wilson, Vice Chair of Richmond Council's Finance, Policy and Resource Committee said:

> "We are incredibly thankful to live in a borough with so many individuals and groups who commit themselves to improving the lives of people who live and work in their communities without expecting anything in return.

> "This year has presented an unprecedented challenge to our communities and local heroes - both groups and individuals - have emerged in response to this challenge.

> "We want to recognise these people and of course those who have, over the entirety of the past year, contributed to making this borough a great place to live and work.

> "They are our community heroes and we want to thank them on behalf of the whole borough. If you know someone who has gone that extra mile we'd like to hear their story, so get in touch and nominate them for one this year's awards."

[Go online](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_heroes) to submit your nomination for any category by Monday 9 November and find out more about last year's winners. You can also find hard copies of the nomination form in the Civic Centre or your local library.

A virtual awards ceremony will be held later this year.

Awards will be made in the following categories:

- Business contribution in the community - Local businesses that have demonstrated commitment to their local area
- Trustee of the Year - For a trustee of a group or charity who has gone above and beyond in their role
- Community Group of the Year - Groups that exemplify what can be done to make a difference when people work together
- Community Project of the Year - Projects and initiatives that have improved our borough and its local communities - run by individuals, groups or voluntary organisations
- Outstanding Volunteer - For individuals who volunteer with a group, charity or organisation
- Environmental Award - For individuals, projects and groups specifically focused on tackling climate change and environmental issues
- Outstanding Sporting Achievement - Those whose efforts and achievements in sport vitalise communities, bring people together and support physical and mental well-being, or those who have achieved significant sporting success representing the borough

- Lifetime Achievement - Those who have shown a long-term commitment to voluntary work and have made a significant contribution to their communities over ten or more years

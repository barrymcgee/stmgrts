Weekly tennis camps will be run for minis and juniors over the  week half-term breaks and summer holidays at York House Gardens.

Mini tennis uses modified equipment on appropriate sized courts to teach children. The syllabus includes ABC's (agility, balance, coordination and speed). Children are introduced to all appropriate shots, techniques and tactics using game play and competition. Coach ratio is 1:6 for tots and 1:8 for other age groups. All coaches are LTA Qualified & DBS checked.

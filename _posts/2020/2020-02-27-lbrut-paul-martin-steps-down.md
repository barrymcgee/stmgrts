Following Chief Executive Paul Martin's decision to step down from his position, Richmond and Wandsworth councils will be launching a search for his successor.

Paul Martin joined Wandsworth Council in 2010, and since 2016 has also been Chief Executive of Richmond Council in an innovative Shared Staffing Arrangement. The shared service is a unique staffing model serving half a million Londoners in south west London and focussed on improving public service, innovation and new ways of working. The shared arrangement has resulted in savings to the two councils of &pound;60 million to date.

Paul is one of the most experienced council Chief Executives in the country, having served in this capacity for over 20 years in a career that has taken him to Greater Manchester, the Midlands, East Anglia as well as London. He is unusual in having served in this capacity in three London boroughs - Sutton (2005/10), Wandsworth (2010/20) and Richmond (2016/20).

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "Paul has been a steady hand on the tiller as we navigated our way through the early years of the Shared Staffing arrangement with Wandsworth.  Although we're still on the journey his professionalism and dedication to effective governance has ensured Richmond Council is on a strong footing as we move forward".

> "There will be time for words of thanks later, but we can rest assured that as we look for his successor that the sterling work he has done with our team here in Richmond will ensure that we attract the very highest calibre of applicants."

Cllr Ravi Govindia, Leader of Wandsworth Council, also paid tribute to Paul Martin:

> "Paul Martin has been Chief Executive at Wandsworth Council throughout my entire time as Leader; and he has carried out the role during a period of transformational change in the borough.

> "We have worked closely together to ensure Wandsworth grows and develops for the benefit of the whole community. Paul has led an exceptional group of officers to enhance Wandsworth's reputation as an exemplar in the way it has risen to these challenges and he leaves a remarkable record of sound achievement.

> "I would like to thank Paul for his decade of service here and wish him every success for the future."

Paul Martin, added:

> "It's been the privilege of my career to be Chief Executive at Wandsworth for the past decade, and also of Richmond since 2016. South West London is widely seen as the most attractive part of the capital city in which to live and work, and this is in no small part due to the work of the two councils.

> "For the past four years, our shared service has delivered &pound;60 million efficiency savings across the two boroughs, meaning we can provide better social care, cleaner streets and more parks and leisure services than would have otherwise been the case. All of this is down to our fantastic staff group which has risen to every challenge asked of them.

> "It's not an easy decision to leave such a fantastic job, but I know in my heart this is the right time for a new Chief Executive to take the two councils into their next phase of growth and development. My successor will find the spirit of municipal ambition alive and well amongst our members and staff".

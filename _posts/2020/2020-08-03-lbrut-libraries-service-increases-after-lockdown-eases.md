As part of our phased reopening of our libraries, an extra hour of click and collect will now be added at seven local libraries, with public computer access available at the Information and Reference Library in Richmond.

From today (3 August) selected libraries will be opening between 10.30am - 12.30pm and 1.30pm - 3.30pm - giving readers an extra hour every day to use the Click & Collect service.

The following libraries are now open for collection from Monday to Saturday from 10.30am - 12.30pm and 1.30pm - 3.30pm:

- East Sheen
- Ham Library (closed Thursdays and Saturdays)
- Hampton Hill Library (closed Tuesdays)
- Richmond Lending Library
- Teddington Library
- Twickenham Library
- Whitton Library.

The computers in the Information and Reference Library will also be available to use during these hours for one 45-minute session per day per customer. Computer bookings can be made by telephone on 020 8734 3308.

Residents can browse the library service's online catalogue to choose what they would like to read. Books should be reserved online and residents will be notified when they are available for collection. Those without internet access can telephone 020 8734 3330 and staff will place reservations. Lines are open between 10am and 4pm Monday to Saturday.

Staff will quarantine returned books as recommended for 72 hours before passing them on to another reader, in order to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. When residents arrive at the library to collect their books, a queuing system will be in place outside - ensuring social distancing.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Arts and Libraries, said:

> "We are pleased that so many people have been using our Click and Collect service - so much so, we are increasing the capacity.

> "Additional services will resume over the next couple of months and more library buildings will start to provide the Click & Collect service. Please keep checking the library website to stay up to date with developments. We really appreciate your patience and understanding."

Library services remain limited as government guidelines state that all incoming library books and resources need to be quarantined for 72 hours. This means many of the library's public spaces are being used to store quarantined items and as such there is insufficient space to resume normal services and be able to socially distance. A limited browsing service will be introduced from 1 September 2020.

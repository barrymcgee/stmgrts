A radical new solution to the on-going closure of Hammersmith Bridge, negating the need for a second temporary bridge structure, has been welcomed by Richmond Council.

Hammersmith & Fulham (H&F) Council have revealed plans to build a temporary double-decker crossing within the existing structure of Hammersmith Bridge. A new raised truss structure would be built above the existing road deck, featuring a lower level for pedestrians and cyclists and an upper level for cars and buses. This would allow existing approach routes for traffic to be used.

H&F Council have said the structure will also provide support for the bridge as well as a safe platform for restoration work to be carried out. There would be no load added to the existing bridge deck, which would be removed in stages for repair and restoration off-site which could allow works to be done at greater speed and at a reduced cost. When completed, the temporary raised deck would be removed.

The concept plan designed by Foster   Partners and further developed with specialist bridge engineers COWI, will be presented by H&F Council to Department of Transport officials today (26 November).

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "This is a very welcome and interesting development. Obviously, it's early days but this could well be the solution to getting traffic moving over the river as quickly as possible. We're incredibly hopeful that this will be the realistic solution we've all been waiting for.

> "I'm grateful to the Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, Stephen Cowan, who gave me advance notice of this plan and has also given me a guarantee that Richmond's highways, engineering and planning officers will not only be given an early briefing on the detail of these plans, but will also form part of the design review team so they can have early insight and input into the implications for Richmond's side of the bridge.

> "I very much hope that this innovative proposal will be warmly received by both Government and local residents alike."

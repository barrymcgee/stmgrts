Richmond Council welcomes the opening of Twickenham Station - providing a modern, first class gateway to the borough for residents, commuters and businesses.

In December 2011, Richmond Council's Planning Committee granted planning permission for a proposal by Solum, an external developer, to improve the station.

Work commenced in the Spring 2017. Now, three years later a new, modern station has been built on a podium over the main rail lines. This has enabled a new and improved entrance to a relocated ticket office, providing direct access to the platforms via steps and lifts. Construction has also nearly finished on retail units around the open plaza.

Whilst the station entrance has now opened, the work is still ongoing, with the final phase of the redevelopment estimated to be completed in the Spring 2021. This will include new station car parking, taxi pick up, 150 additional cycle racks to be provided with a new cycle store integrated within the building and additional homes at the side of the site.

To support the development, outside the station, the Council has completed new widened pavement, a new signal crossing built directly outside the new station entrance, new bus stop/shelter and taxi facilities.

Cllr Alexander Ehmann, Chair of the Transport and Air Quality Committee and Richmond Council, said:

> "Our Twickenham station is finally open! I would like to thank all the neighbouring residents for their considerable patience and understanding while the works were ongoing. I know it has been tough over the past few years - but the improvements to the station were much needed, including the absolutely vital upgrades to accessibility.

> "Having a first-class station for the community in Twickenham and for our many visitors is vitally important. Every year hundreds of thousands of people arrive at Twickenham station and now their first impressions of Twickenham will be as positive as the experiences they go on to have in our wider community."

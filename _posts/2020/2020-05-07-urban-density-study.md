excerpt: |
    It is hard to find land in London to build on. One suggestion is to increase density - to allow more to be built on a piece of land. To this end, my colleagues and I at the London School of Economics have put together a survey to better understand what Outer London residents think about this.

It is hard to find land in London to build on. One suggestion is to increase density - to allow more to be built on a piece of land. To this end, my colleagues and I at the London School of Economics have put together a survey to better understand what Outer London residents think about this.

The survey can be accessed by clicking on the link below and then, after having read the instructions, by clicking 'Continue'. It consists of two parts. The first is a short questionnaire and the second contains a series of images for the participant to respond to. More detailed information, including a consent form, can be found on the survey's introduction page. Participants are encouraged to complete the survey by May 31. Responses will be anonymous. If there are any technical questions or issues, please feel free to email: [j.g.karlsson@lse.ac.uk](mailto:j.g.karlsson@lse.ac.uk).

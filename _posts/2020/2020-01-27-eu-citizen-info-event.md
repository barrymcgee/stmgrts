A free public information evening for EU citizens living in the borough will be held at the Clarendon Hall, York House, on the 18 February from 6pm.

The event will be opened by Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council. Attendees will be able to get updates on the latest Brexit developments and find out what steps they need to take to protect their future in the UK.

The event is delivered by Citizens Advice Richmond as part of a package of support, funded by the Council, aimed at enabling EU residents to get impartial, expert advice on nationality matters or the impact of the Government's proposals and options available for them.

Although the event is free you do need to register to attend. You can also sign up for e-updates from Citizens Advice Richmond.

In addition, European residents are reminded that Citizens Advice Richmond can offer one-to-one help for people who are having difficulty applying for settled status, for example because of disability or lack of internet access. Contact them to make an appointment.

Cllr Roberts, said:

> "I am disappointed that the result of the General Election means we will now be leaving the EU on January 31<sup>st</sup>. This makes it all the more vital that EU27 citizens living in the borough make be as sure as they can be about their rights will be as we move into the transition period.

> "I know the EU citizens living in our borough still have questions about the process and steps you need to take to secure your future in the United Kingdom and hopefully this info evening will answer some of those questions.

> "And remember, you have friends here at Richmond Council. We know the value you bring to our communities and we are determined to support you throughout the Brexit process."

More information about Brexit and associated support is available on the Citizens Advice Richmond website. For information about the events: [www.citizensadvicerichmond.org/public-information-events](http://www.citizensadvicerichmond.org/public-information-events)

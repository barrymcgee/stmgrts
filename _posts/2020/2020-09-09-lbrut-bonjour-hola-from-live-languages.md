  Hooray. Youpi. Hurra. Now the kids or grandchildren are back at school, why don't you too learn or perfect a language ? I run adult French conversation classes from Intermediate to Advanced level with maximum 6 per group. There are limited spaces in person or on Zoom. N'h&#233;sitez pas si vous &#234;tes int&#233;ress&#233;(es).

New : I am resuming our popular Spanish lesson, 1-1 or small groups, all levels welcome.

If you're worried that language learning is only for children, [here's one of countless studies proving the opposite](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2NsHY4MhL95FgclByxS1XRl/can-learning-a-new-language-boost-your-brain)

Please email or call for more information or to speak to a current student.

Note: _Lessons only available before 3pm during school hours, and can be face to face or online._

A bient&#244;t. Hasta pronto :-)

Do you have a big idea about a project for the area where you live but get stuck on how to pay for it? Why not apply now for the Richmond Community Fund?

The Richmond Council Community Fund comes from the Community Infrastructure Levy. A tax paid by developers to help reduce the impact of a development, a portion of the total tax collected will fund local priority projects.

This money might be used for a variety of projects, including; green space improvements, resources and equipment for community use or community centre renovations.

Any local resident, business or community group, living or located within the borough can bring forward a proposal.

[The fund is now open and will close on 4<sup>th</sup> December. For more information or to apply.](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/community_fund)

Cllr Michael Wilson, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Equalities, Communities and the Voluntary Sector, said:

> "We know that residents have a strong vision for the future of their community - particularly during these difficult times. This fund will help make some of the community ideas and initiatives a reality.

> "I hope many more community organisations and local groups will get involved and work with Council officers and local ward councillors to bring forward strong project proposals for funding."

Amounts available in Round Four include:

- &pound;161,000 for the East of the Borough (Richmond, East Sheen, Barnes, Mortlake and Kew)
- &pound;252,000 for the West of the Borough (Twickenham, St Margarets, Whitton, Heathfield, Hampton, Hampton Hill, Fulwell, Strawberry Hill, Teddington and Hampton Wick)

There has been no levy collected in the Ham and Petersham Neighbourhood Plan since their plan was ratified in 2019/20.

Previous projects that have been successful in being granted Community Fund monies, range from a toy library scheme, new community caf&#233; and kitchen, restoration of a local church Hall, new electric vehicle for a local youth group and improvements on a local high street.

This money might be used for a variety of projects, including; green space improvements, resources and equipment for community use or community centre renovations.

Any local resident, business or community group, living or based within the borough can bring forward a proposal which should be for more than &pound;5,000 and must meet certain criteria.

_The Petersham Consort present a concert of meditations for Lent by Buxtehude, Tallis and Gjeilo._

#### Programme

- **Membra Jesu nostri** (BuxWV 75) - Dietrich Buxtehude
- **Lamentations of Jeremiah** - Thomas Tallis
- **Northern Lights** - Ola Gjeilo

The Petersham Consort, directed by Ben Driver, are delighted to return to the beautiful Georgian Church of St Mary's, Twickenham (TW1 3NJ) to present a short concert of meditations for Lent and Passiontide on Sunday 22<sup>nd</sup> March 2020 at 6 pm.

Our centrepiece is a celebration of the first Lutheran oratorio, Buxtehude's masterpiece Membra Jesu nostri, whose main text is from the Mediaeval hymn Salve mundi salutare, a meditation on the crucified Christ set for five voices, strings and organ. Dieterich Buxtehude (1637-1707), a Danish-German organist and composer of the Baroque period, wrote music in a wide variety of vocal and instrumental idioms, and his style strongly influenced many who followed him, including JS Bach.

To accompany this wonderful work we offer you the Lamentations of Jeremiah by the Elizabethan composer Thomas Tallis (1505-1585), also written for this sacred time of year. Set for unaccompanied male voices, it is his final and probably most highly respected composition. Our performance will finish with Northern Lights, a mesmeric setting of the Pulchra Es poem from the Song of Solomon, which celebrates the beauty and power of God's gift of love. Written by the contemporary Norwegian composer Ola Gjeilo (b. 1978), its original inspiration was the ethereal phenomenon of the Aurora Borealis.

This concert is free and there will be a retiring collection in aid of the church's planned building and refurbishment work. You are invited to stay for drinks served in the chancel afterwards.

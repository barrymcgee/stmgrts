New helpline to support residents in need.

We have set-up a Community Hub to co-ordinate the support being offered by the Council and Richmond's many voluntary organisations.

From Tuesday 24 March, we are launching a new helpline as a first response for residents, particularly those elderly and/or vulnerable without support networks, who need support to access medical/care services and food supplies. This is to help those most in need stay safe and well while they self-isolate at home.

Some people with specific underlying health issues, who are at higher risk of severe illness if you contract COVID-19, will also be hearing from the NHS directly about how to best protect yourselves. The Government is launching its Local Support Scheme, which will link in with the Community Hub to support those for whom self-isolation is most critical.

If you or someone you know needs this support, please contact 0208 871 6555 or  [covid19support@richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk](mailto:covid19support@richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk). This helpline can also be used for other enquiries related to COVID-19, for anyone in need of support.

For all medical enquiries please continue to contact the NHS on [111.nhs.uk](https://111.nhs.uk) or on 111.

For all general enquiries about Council services, please check [richmond.gov.uk](https://richmond.gov.uk) for updates or call the main Contact Centre on 0208 891 1411.

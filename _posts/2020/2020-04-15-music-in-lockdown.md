I am Director of Music at St Peter's Church in Petersham. In this capacity have been learning to use simple video-editing software in order to record a small choir in isolation and make harmony from their recordings. On impulse last week I wrote to friends in several countries and at little notice they sent in 35 tracks including singers, flutes, oboes, saxes, a cor anglais, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, strings and organ.

Learning as I went, I edited and stitched these together to make this wonderful hymn for Easter Sunday. To my amazement it's already had hundreds of views.

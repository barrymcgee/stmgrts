Twickenham Police Station will be undergoing redevelopment in February 2020.

Refurbishment of the station is expected to take between six and nine months. During this time, most staff will move to Teddington Police Station, some will relocate to Kingston and some Neighbourhood officers will continue to use Twickenham as their base.

The front counter at Twickenham Police Station closed on Friday 24 January.

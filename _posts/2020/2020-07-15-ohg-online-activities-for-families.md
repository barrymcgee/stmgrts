Whilst we were unable to deliver our usual family art workshops, Orleans House Gallery has been busy during lockdown creating activities for families to do together at home.

Activities are designed for children aged 4 upwards and based around the Orleans House Gallery Collection. We have 12 weeks of activities for you to do.

#### Sunday Afternoon Art Online

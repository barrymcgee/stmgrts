Richmond Art House Open Studio Festival is offering young visual artists, designers and makers from across the borough the opportunity to take part in the 2020 Open Studios Festival for free, as part of its new First Steps Programme initiative.

The annual festival, which celebrates visual arts in the borough, takes place over the final two weekends in June, Friday 19 to Sunday 21 and Friday 26 to Sunday 28 June.

This year's festival is looking to attract first time exhibitors in an effort to encourage young artists to showcase their work as part of the hugely popular Open Studios Festival with event organisers offering a limited number of free spaces to artists under the age of 30, or those on certain state benefits, if they are a Richmond resident and have not previously taken part in a Richmond Open Studios Festival.

The Open Studios festival invites local visual artists, designers & makers living or working in the borough to open their houses, studios or found spaces to the public to develop and showcase their practice and work. This year's festival will encourage residents to support borough-based makers and enterprise by buying unique, local, handcrafted pieces.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "We are delighted to be able to make the Art House Open Studios Festival more accessible for those talented local artists who are at the beginning of their careers or those who otherwise may not be able to take part in this great celebration of art in our borough."

More information and online applications to take part in Art House Open Studio 2020 can be found via [www.richmond.gov.uk/arthouse_open_studios](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/arthouse_open_studios ). The deadline for artist applications is Saturday 29 February.

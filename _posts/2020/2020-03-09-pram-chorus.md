    Pram Chorus is more than a choir - it's a community, where everyone is welcomed and supported in a non-judgemental way.  The experience of becoming a parent can be a lonely one: thrust into a brave new world of sleepless nights and being at the mercy of a tiny one's needs, so having a friendly, non-judgemental place to go, where everyone understands, can be a life-saver.

*Pram Chorus is a new daytime choir for parents in Twickenham, and babies can come along too!*

Pram Chorus is more than a choir - it's a community, where everyone is welcomed and supported in a non-judgemental way.  The experience of becoming a parent can be a lonely one: thrust into a brave new world of sleepless nights and being at the mercy of a tiny one's needs, so having a friendly, non-judgemental place to go, where everyone understands, can be a life-saver.

Parents can bring their babies or toddlers to the session, but the singing is for the grown-ups. There's no audition, and nobody will be asked to sing on their own. Every Pram Chorus session incorporates "cake and chat" time.

Research shows the many positive mental health benefits of group singing, and recent studies demonstrate that group singing reduces symptoms of postnatal depression faster than either usual treatments or creative play groups, amongst women with moderate to severe symptoms.

Pram Chorus Twickenham is led by local mum and professional singer Sara Feldmann Brummer, an experienced choral leader and singing teacher. Aside from getting people to make sounds they've never even dreamed of, Sara is supportive and understanding of the challenges of parenthood and creates a warm, welcoming place to come together. No singing experience or talent is required - just rock up and sing!

The choir rehearses on term-time Wednesdays, 1.30pm - 2.30pm at The Cross Way Centre (St. Stephen's Church) in East Twickenham. The venue is easily accessible from Twickenham, St. Margaret's and Richmond, and has buggy parking and baby changing facilities.

There will be two taster sessions happening on 18<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> March to whet the appetite, which parents can attend for a discounted price of &pound;5 per session. The choir then begins its full term on 22<sup>nd</sup> April.

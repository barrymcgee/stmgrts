An emergency supply of masks and aprons were delivered to Richmond Council today (Friday 27 March) by the British Army.

Richmond's social care staff provide support for some of the most vulnerable and frail people in the borough. Social care workers, operating in residential care homes and in people's own homes have been increasingly concerned that the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was placing the health of their clients and themselves at risk.

This afternoon, British Army personnel delivered limited supplies to enable staff to continue their work safely. These supplies are now being distributed to care homes and other key workers.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, welcomed the PPE as it arrived. He said:

> "Given the critical role social care workers are playing, it is absolutely essential that they are fully protected.

> "We had experienced issues obtaining supplies of PPE given the unprecedented demand across country. These supplies that provide a short term boost to Council and providers staff is welcome but we recognise more will be needed and we will continue to work with the Government and NHS to ensure longer term supplies.

> "Social workers provide a lifeline for so many of our vulnerable residents - enabling many people to stay independent in their own homes. It is imperative that they stay healthy.

> "The health and safety of our workforce and those who use our services is paramount, and I would like to thank the Armed Forces for their assistance in ensuring we receive this basic safety equipment."

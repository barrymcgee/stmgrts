The current coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on the work of public services locally. Richmond Council would like to hear from residents on how this has affected their lives and what services they have received.

The survey is part of the borough's Community Conversation programme. Feedback will be used to identify local support needs, help with sign posting to assistance programmes and identify measures that will help with the recovery from the crisis.

The survey looks at a number of issues, including; employment, financial support, mental health, access to services, education, community safety and links to the community. It also tries to understand how local behaviours might change in the future - including working from home, more active travel or volunteering.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "During these unprecedented times it is crucial that as a Local Authority we keep connected with local people, seeing how the pandemic is affecting lives, what services people are accessing and how we can help people in the future. I would encourage all residents to take part in the survey and help us work together on our response to the coronavirus crisis."

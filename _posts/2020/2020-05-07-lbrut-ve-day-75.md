A special floral bedding display has been planted in Terrace Gardens in Richmond to commemorate the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of war in Europe.

Known as VE Day - or Victory in Europe Day - the commemoration falls on Friday 8 May 2020 and is when Nazi Germany surrendered, and guns fell silent in Europe during the Second World War.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, VE Day 75 events and street parties have been cancelled or postponed whilst we stay home and save lives.

However, the Council has organised a number of activities to mark the occasion. This includes special bedding in Terrace Gardens, where coloured bedding plants have been planted to mark out the shape *'VE Day, 75 Years'*, along with a red poppy.  The prominent display is laid out in raised bedding in front of the Father Thames statue within the Gardens and is visible from Petersham Road.

In addition to this, the Council is encouraging households to also mark the occasion and honour the men and women of WW2 by creating bunting to display outside their homes.

Hang your bunting with pride over the weekend Friday 8 May - Sunday 10 May and share your pictures on social media using the hashtags `#GreatBritishBunting` and `#RichmondVEDay`.

Cllr Nancy Baldwin, Mayor of Richmond upon Thames, said:

> "The 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of VE - Victory in Europe day - is a day worth marking - the beginning of the end of WWII.  It's a time to celebrate the ending of hostilities in Europe which meant that future generations could live in peace.  It is also a time to remember the great sacrifice asked of our fellow countrymen which made that victory and peace possible.  Unfortunately, rather than at street parties, we will need to commemorate the day in our homes to keep safe - remembering the elation felt by our grandparents and great grandparents that peace had come to Europe at last."

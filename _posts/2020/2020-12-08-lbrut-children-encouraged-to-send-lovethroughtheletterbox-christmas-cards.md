Children are encouraged to create and write Christmas cards for care home residents in the borough to help spread festive cheer to those amongst the most affected by COVID-19.

Residents may remember the first #LoveThroughTheLetterbox campaign in the summer, which saw over 450 love-filled letters delivered to care homes.

The Christmas edition of #LoveThroughTheLetterbox is an opportunity for children to get creative and to let the older generation know that we continue to think of them. The card doesn't necessarily have to include words - artworks and drawings are also welcomed.

Please encourage the young people in your life to create Christmas cards. Send your cards to:

<pre>
Love Through The Letterbox Christmas
Civic Centre
44 York Street
Twickenham
TW1 3BZ
</pre>

Richmond Council will forward the cards to care homes that want to be involved.

It is hoped that this campaign spreads joy far and wide, so please help raise awareness of #LoveThroughTheLetterbox by using the hashtag on social media and sharing photos of the letters your young person has written.

Cllr Piers Allen, Chair of the Adult Social Services, Health & Housing Committee and the Richmond Health & Wellbeing Board, said:

> "#LoveThroughTheLetterbox is a wonderful way to bring generations together during this difficult time. We had so many amazing letters delivered over the summer that it would be such a shame not to do a Christmas card version of the campaign! I hope lots of people take part and help spread some festive love and goodwill."

Christmas cards will be delivered to care homes the week beginning 21 December so please make sure your cards arrive at the Civic Centre before then. If you have any questions or would like some more information, please contact  [fenna.maynard@richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk](mailto:fenna.maynard@richmondandwandsworth.gov.uk).

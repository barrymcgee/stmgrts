Future public sectors stars can apply now to the Richmond and Wandsworth councils' Graduate Development Programme.

The programme, now in its eighth year provides graduates with a broad range of development and career opportunities.

The two-year programme offers graduates the chance to take on real opportunities in at least four different placements in key areas of the Shared Staffing Arrangement for Richmond and Wandsworth councils. This could include working in the parks department, business, children's services, housing, regeneration or adult social care.

Both councils are looking to attract innovative, adaptable and enthusiastic individuals with a commitment to public service to take part in a wide range of projects, placements and development activities. The roles are an opportunity to make a real contribution towards the impact and efficiency of public services as communities and businesses recover from the impacts of Covid-19.

Paul Martin, Chief Executive of Richmond and Wandsworth councils, said:

> "As both Richmond and Wandsworth are working hard to support local communities and businesses through the pandemic, it is important that we have talented, ambitious staff who are hungry to learn and can help both councils and the Shared Staffing Arrangement develop and improve.

> "Our graduate programme has been very successful since it launched. We have invested in our trainees' development and we offer them the opportunities to reach their potential. Many of our previous graduates are now taking their first steps into long term careers with us".

Louis Osman, a current Graduate on the SSA programme, added:

> "The Graduate Scheme with Richmond and Wandsworth councils interested me for many reasons, but a crucial selling point was the structure of the scheme, whereby you have the opportunity to work across four different directorates. This naturally exposes you to many areas within the Councils and is a great way for someone who does not have a specific interest to work in multiple departments, learn new skills and how different departments operate, and ultimately find their niche.

> "If you are like me and are unsure about exactly what you want to do coming out of uni, this is the scheme for you! You have a unique opportunity to work, and meet with, a myriad of groups, such as in the voluntary sector, different teams of Council staff, and Councillors themselves. This coupled with the tremendous training programmes on offer will allow you to develop as a person personally and professionally, which will ultimately stand you in good stead for whatever trajectory or path you want your career to take!"

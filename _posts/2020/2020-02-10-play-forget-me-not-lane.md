Forget-Me-Not Lane is a charming, nostalgic and very funny play penned by Peter Nichols, who sadly died last year just as his play _A Day in the Death of Joe Egg_ was enjoying a revival.

It's a bittersweet play about fathers, families--and "a youth which was bitter to live through but sweet to remember".

Middle-aged Frank is packing his suitcase as he talks about his life. He recalls his childhood and adolescence during the Second World War, watching the experiences of his younger self with a mixture of amiable amusement and mortification.

He relives the exasperating pedantry of his father Charles and the cheerful stoicism of his long-suffering mother Amy, shared adventures with his best friend Ivor, and his awkward flirtations with schoolmate Ursula, later to be his wife.

Frank is gloomily disappointed by the contrast between his teenage sweetheart and the tired mother Ursula has become, gradually exposing his dissatisfaction with family life, and his horror at how he seems to be repeating his parents' mistakes.

*First performed in 1971 at the Greenwich Theatre London*

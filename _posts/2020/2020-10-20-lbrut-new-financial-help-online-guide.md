A new online guide has been launched for those needing some additional help accessing food, household essentials, paying for bills, rent or their mortgage as a result of Covid-19.

Through the pandemic the Council has worked hard to support residents via our community hub, emergency grants or by awarding funding to local organisations who have been linking people to services such as food, check-in calls or medication collection.

In our last resident survey, over 30% of local people said they have suffered financially as a result of the pandemic. As London now has moved into Tier Two, with further Covid-19 restrictions, coupled with the end of the furlough scheme, we are anticipating that even more people will need help.

Cllr Gareth Roberts, Leader of Richmond Council, said:

> "The Council is doing all it can to help people be able to feed themselves and their families and understand what support is available to pay bills, rent or a mortgage.

> "Over the past few months we have provided over &pound;210,000 funding to local voluntary sector groups to help them provide vital services or grants to support those who need help.

> "There is a lot of support out there. To help people easily identify where they can get help, our new online directory pulls it all together in one place."

The directory is available: [www.richmond.gov.uk/i_need_help](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/i_need_help)

To support those who do not have access to the internet, a hard copy of the booklet has been produced and has been sent to all households in the borough.

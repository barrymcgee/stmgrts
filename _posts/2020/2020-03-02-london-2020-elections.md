With the Mayor of London and London Assembly elections scheduled for Thursday 7 May, the borough's electoral services team are ready to make sure everyone who is entitled to vote is able to do so.

Residents who are not already on the electoral register must register by midnight on Tuesday 21 April 2020. If you receive and pay Council Tax bills you are not automatically included on the register.

You can check if your name appears on the register by completing the form available here: [www.richmond.gov.uk/elections_voting_and_registration](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/elections_voting_and_registration)

Residents who are registered and would like a postal vote or wish to make changes to their existing postal or proxy vote are being advised that they must submit their applications by Wednesday 22 April.

If you are already permanently registered for a postal vote you will not need to apply again. British citizens, along with citizens of qualifying Commonwealth countries, EU residents and British Overseas Territories are all eligible to vote in this election.  British citizens who live overseas and are registered as overseas electors will not be able to vote in these elections.

Ahead of polling day all registered electors who are entitled to vote in the London elections will receive a polling card showing them the location of their polling station. The cards are not actually required to be able to vote. If they are lost or mislaid electors will be able to find where their local polling station is in the days running up to the election by keying in their full postcode at [www.richmond.gov.uk/myrichmond](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/myrichmond)

On 7 May polling stations will be open between 7am and 10pm. The votes will be counted on Friday 8 May. Counting will take place across London.

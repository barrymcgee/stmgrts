Self-employed residents are reminded to go online and apply for a Government grant to help them if their business has been affected by coronavirus.

Applications for the temporary Self Employed Income Support Scheme opened last week, enabling people to claim a taxable grant of 80% of their average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months, and capped at &pound;7,500 altogether.

You can claim this grant if you're a self-employed individual or a member of a partnership and all of the following apply:

- You traded in the tax year 2018 to 2019 and submitted your Self Assessment tax return on or before 23 April 2020 for that year
- You traded in the tax year 2019 to 2020
- You intend to continue to trade in the tax year 2020 to 2021
- You carry on a trade which has been adversely affected by coronavirus

Your business could be adversely affected by coronavirus if, for example:

You are unable to work because you:

- Are shielding
- Are self-isolating
- Are on sick leave because of coronavirus
- Have caring responsibilities because of coronavirus

Or you've had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:

- Your supply chain has been interrupted
- You have fewer or no customers or clients
- Your staff are unable to come in to work

Cllr Robin Brown, Lead Member for Finance at Richmond Council, said:

> "The Council will continue to work in partnership with other organisations to provide as much advice and support as possible to our entire business community. It is vital that we retain as many of our fantastic local businesses as possible as they all add a huge amount of value not just to our economy but to the quality of life of our residents and communities."

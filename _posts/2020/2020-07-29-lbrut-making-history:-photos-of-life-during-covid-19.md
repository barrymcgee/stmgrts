Can you help create a visual diary of the Covid-19 pandemic for future generations to study and learn from? Richmond Library Services is looking for photographs that document life in Richmond upon Thames during the pandemic.

The Local Studies Library and Archive has already invited residents to start and to share diary entries of their experiences, which may include how daily routines have had to change, any struggles and general thoughts.

To support this, the Library is now looking for photographs of the borough during lockdown, as well as more current photos of lockdown measures easing.

Digital photographs can be emailed to  [localstudies@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:localstudies@richmond.gov.uk). If you have lots of photographs, please email the same address and a link will be provided for you to transfer the files. Hardcopy photographs can be posted to: Local Studies Library & Archive, Old Town Hall, Whittaker Avenue, Richmond, TW9 1TP.

Alternatively, hardcopy documents can be handed to us in person once Local Studies is open again. To arrange this, please email  [localstudies@richmond.gov.uk](mailto:localstudies@richmond.gov.uk)

The Library is continuing to collect people's diaries in the same way as above. Diary creators will need signed statements to say they are happy for the contents to be open to the public.

Cllr John Coombs, Lead Member for Libraries and Culture, said:

> "We are living through a hugely important period of history and people's diaries and photographs will help those who come to study this period. It will allow future generations to understand how the pandemic affected people's everyday lives through their observations and feelings.

> "Any photos you have of the borough during this time will be helpful, so please share them with us and help capture this moment in history."

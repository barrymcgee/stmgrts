### Museums-Tired of the Science and Natural History museum – try these!

There are banknotes and gold bars on display and plenty of hands-on exhibits for fledgling bankers. (Should have reopened on 2 May 2006 after redecoration, but please check before you visit.)
-   Another fascinating insight into domestic life can be found at the **Geffrye Museum** ([www.geffrye-museum.org.uk](http://www.geffrye-museum.org.uk/)). The displays lead the visitor through domestic interiors from the 17th century to the present time. There are wonderful period gardens and an award-winning herb garden too.
-   **The National Maritime Museum** ([www.nmm.ac.uk](http://www.nmm.ac.uk/)) houses the world's largest collection of items relating to seafaring. Special children's activities, such as games for younger children and worksheets for the older ones, are on offer.

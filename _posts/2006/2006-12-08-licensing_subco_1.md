The hearing that was to question the _Richmond Council Licensing Sub-Committee's_ procedure in the Par Vinu wine bar case has been withdrawn by the complainants.

> "Just to let you know that we have withdrawn the appeal (the hearing to have been 30th November).

> In brief -- we were advised by Counsel that although she felt there was a very high probability that the court would recommend that the Application should be re-heard by the court or the LBRUT -- she had little doubt that the Application would still eventually stand. The applicants have made it quite clear that should they subsequently win they would make a claim for 'consequential' loses against us, Counsel advises that irrespective of even if the reason for a re-hearing was down to LBRUT the applicants could still claim against us - that is one of the quirks of the law. As we understand that claim could be for a very substantial amount, we've decided it's too risky. So much for the 'right' of appeal."

Last night was the third [Moormead Park Meeting](/event/Meeting/200603301408) in Winchester Hall. The following note was send by Claire Wilson recapping the meeting. We should have more detailed notes on the site in the next day or so.

<div markdown="1" class="letter">
Thank you to everyone who joined us last night. The general feeling was that plans agreed for Moormead were progressing well and at the right pace. Following the previous meeting a group of parents had helped choose the furniture for the children's playground, these designs were presented last night. Eve Risbridger told the group that they were hoping to have it open for St Margaret's Fair on 15 July. There would also be new lighting along the path in front of the playground as had been requested.

The future of the pavilion was discussed in some depth. There was general agreement that it needed refurbishing, to what standard and for what use was felt to require wider and further discussion. A presentation from Bazil Arden of Canonbury Gardens (Kingston) outlined some new thinking on the potential for growing the pavilion as a community resource. Their pavilion had been saved through local action and a team of committed volunteers. The response to this was that the idea of asking the community to help as part of the first stage of refurbishment; making good the inside, external painting, new windows, would be useful to see if there were people willing to take it on as a volunteer project. A more detailed mailing is being produced.

The issue of parking was discussed in relation to potential increased traffic.
Eve Risbridger has offered to survey current use to see if, as is believed, the predominant use of the park is by local residents in St Margarets.

A smaller group met to discuss landscaping, bulb planting in the park.

If anyone would like further details or to offer their help, please contact Claire Wilson; 020 8744 0700 email; <corpunit@aol.com>

    Abigail has lived in St Margarets for six years, originally hailing from Scotland where she danced with Scottish Ballet, the country's national ballet company.

    Last year she opened <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/art/200607060232,">Marble Hill Dance Studio</a> which started with 20 students and now boasts 70, all through word of mouth. Abigail decided to open the school as she felt the area was lacking a local dance school. The school has 100% pass rate in all examinations taken including the Vocational Graded Royal Academy of Dance Syllabus. The school is based at her husband's pub -- <a href="https://stmargarets.london/directory/pub/200506090609">The Crown</a> that is situated on Richmond Road. The function room has been specially equipped with mirrors and barres to accommodate dance lessons.

Abigail has lived in St Margarets for six years, originally hailing from Scotland where she danced with Scottish Ballet, the country's national ballet company.

Last year she opened [Marble Hill Dance Studio](/directory/art/200607060232), which started with 20 students and now boasts 70, all through word of mouth. Abigail decided to open the school as she felt the area was lacking a local dance school. The school has 100% pass rate in all examinations taken including the Vocational Graded Royal Academy of Dance Syllabus. The school is based at her husband's pub -- [The Crown](/directory/pub/200506090609) that is situated on Richmond Road. The function room has been specially equipped with mirrors and barres to accommodate dance lessons.

Abigail started dancing at the age of seven on the advice of a physiotherapist. She trained with Scottish Ballet's Junior Associate Programme before joining their affiliated school. She then went on to train with the London's Royal Ballet and Central School of Ballet, before returning to her roots to join Scottish ballet.

Due to a demand for summer courses Abigail is teaming up with two colleagues to present a week of dance and drama, culminating with an in-~~house performance. Come and learn new skills, make new friends and enjoy all your favourite Disney classics such as The Lion King and Cinderella. Previous experience is not necessary -~~ just bags of energy and enthusiasm! Classes are led by Abigail, Lizzie and Laura -- fully qualified and CRB--checked dance and LAMDA drama specialists. Abigail, Lizzie and Laura originally trained as professional performers, appearing in such productions as *Seven Bides for Seven Brothers*, *La Fille mal Gardee* and *Peak Practice*. They have a wealth of teaching experience both in the Private and Public sector, and specialise in devising fun yet challenging workshops suitable for all abilities.

Marble Hill Dance Studio offers a free trial class and aims to be a community dance centre. With opportunities for all types of dance for all types of people. It increases self awareness and confidence, improves social skills, encourages discipline, and enhances gross motor skills, musicality and rhythm alternatively you could just want to refresh memories of something you did or perhaps always wanted to do as a child. Abigail started because she had knock knees and feet that turned inwards she ended up dancing professionally and now running her own dance studio so you never know!

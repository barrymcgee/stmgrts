A petition containing 1200 signatures was presented to the full Council meeting on Tuesday 13 June by Councillor Geoff Acton on behalf of the St Margarets' Traders requesting introduction of thirty minutes free parking for shoppers on Crown Road.

The parking problems and restrictions in the area are well known and both traders and shoppers alike would like to see thirty minute free parking introduced as soon as possible. It would enable people to quickly call in for what they need and avoid having to find somewhere to buy a thirty pence voucher and is similar to other schemes in the borough.

Simon Chapman, chairman of the local Traders Association said; "We have been campaigning for this for a while as it will help local traders and improve customer service significantly by allowing short term stopping and preventing illegal parking in bus stops and on yellow lines. We hope the Council take a positive view and go ahead with the scheme as it will certainly help business in the difficult trading conditions we are now experiencing."

The petition will now be passed to David Trigg, the Cabinet Member for Transport for due consideration and discussion at the next appropriate Cabinet meeting.

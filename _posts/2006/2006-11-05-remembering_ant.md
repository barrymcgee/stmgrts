Sadly last week, Anthony Wilkinson died. Anthony was a long serving station manager at the St Margarets station, who retired only a few years previously. There is a condolence book at the station.

> Many residents will remember Tony from the St Margarets Railway Station. After a few years of semi-retirement, Tony died suddenly last week.

> A keen photographer, cyclist, motor bike enthusiast, cook, gardener, calligrapher, wine and beer- maker he also taught himself how to play the flute and serenaded many of us over the years from the ticket kiosk.

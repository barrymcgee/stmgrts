> "The council is currently in the process of reviewing its criteria for CPZs throughout the Borough and the decisions about the consultation for our area have now had to be deferred till the autumn.

> We continue to convey the urgency of our area to Cabinet members but have to abide by their timetable although I am told we are pretty much on the top as far as priority wards are concerned."

-- Councillor Ben Khosa

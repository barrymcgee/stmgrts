Mark Sanders, a St Margarets resident, is about to embark on a Charitable adventure and could use your help.

> "On December 28th, myself and two work colleagues, who work for the BBC as Resource Manager, will be attempting to reach Banjul in The Gambia, in a 25 year old Land rover in order to raise money for two important Charities, Cancer Research and Action Aid.

> We are taking part in the Plymouth Banjul Challenge. There are 60 vehicles in total leaving the UK on December 28th, but not in any particular order. It isn't a race, but the challenge is really to make it, especially when you see the list of vehicles that range from Trabants to Skodas. We are lucky in that our Landrover is 4 wheel drive, however unlucky in that it only does 50mph! It can take as little as 10 days to do it, however we are banking on it taking at least 3 weeks with a following wind and not too many breakdowns. Needless to say, we haven't bought a return air ticket from the Gambia yet."

> If you would like to support us in this challenge, and help raise money, please follow the below links to the "Just giving" website where you can read more about our Challenge, and more importantly about the crucial work done by both Charities.

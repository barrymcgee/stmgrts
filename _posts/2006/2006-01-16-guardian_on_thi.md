In the [Guardian's](http://www.guardian.co.uk/) g2 section today there was an interesting article on Sipson, the town most likely to be removed to make way for a third runway at Heathrow Airport.

> <strong>Now you see it ...</strong>

> For at least 855 years, the village of Sipson has stood on Middlesex fields. By 2020, however, it will almost certainly have vanished, its 700 homes, shops, pubs and school flattened to make way for Heathrow's third runway. Patrick Barkham reports on a village living on borrowed time

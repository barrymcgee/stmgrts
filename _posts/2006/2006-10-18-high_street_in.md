At present, there seven shops on our little high street that have just or are about to change. Currently it looks a little depressing, but hopefully things will be a bit brighter in a few month's time. We should note that not all details have been confirmed, but we have been informed of all details by several reliable sources and feel comfortable to print them now.

**No. 35 Crown Road -- Chrysalis Gallery & Framing &gt; Herdmans Carpet Shop**

_Moved from 24 to 35 Crown Road._

> "I have been thinking about this move for several months, we were getting cramped in the old shop and we all needed more space to display the many different types of carpet, vinyl, and wood floors to our customers, the new shop has its own wood floor showroom as well as a lot of good space for customers to browse and move around. The old shop at No. 24 Crown Road will be missed by me as I feel very sentimental about it, after all my children have practically grown up there, my youngest son Joshua was breast fed in that shop when we first opened nearly 20 years ago and the old shop holds many great memories for us all.

> However the new shop is staffed by three of my now grown up sons Martin, Luke, and Jacob, my brothers Lee and Stuart, my sister Sarah, and of course me, we are all looking forward to the new venture."

**No. 24 Crown Road -- Herdmans Carpet Shop &gt; Botanica Medica**

The former Herdman Carpet Shop, will become a medical herbalist, Botanica Medica, run by Jo Dunbar.

> "Jo is a very well trained and experienced healer and treats conditions ranging from a mild pick-me-up to more serious conditions such as chronic fatigue, candida, and the many forms of cancer. Jo is a published author. Her book on treating candida the easy way has sold thousands of copies. This will be Jo's second apothecary and her other shop is in Claygate.

**No. 115 St Margarets Road -- Koblers Bakery &gt; patisserie**

Purchased by an investor, Alison Gallagher and rented to a patisserie. Renovations are underway.

**No. 11 St Margarets Road -- George Frisby, Butcher &gt; ???**

Apparently several butchers have looked at the site. The issue is the cost of refurbishment. If another butcher opens it will be spring 2007.

**No. 6 Crown Road -- Yummy Tots &gt; rug shop?**

Lucy Mogford said they had to shut down Yummy Tots because she was expecting her second child and running the shop was too much.

According to two sources the most likely tenant is a rug and glassware trader.

**No. 91 Crown Road -- Yummy Mummy &gt; Cocoon Spa**

Emma Callaway and another local resident have bought the Yummy Mummy shop and are in the process of refurbishing the site.

~~According to Kerrie Dorman, the former owner of Yummy Mummy, "the new Salon at the Yummy Mummy site will be honouring all gift Vouchers and Loyalty Cards."~~ _Apparently this is not true, please check with Cocoon._

**No. 125 St Margarets Road -- Phelps basement &gt; Par Vinu**

This site was part of the sprawling basement showroom of the Phelps Antiques shop. It will become an upscale wine bar with an entrance through a renovated Streets green grocers.

*After their recent [conditional planning approval](/archives/2006/03/wine_bar_gets_t.html) we asked the principles of the wine bar if they wanted to comment. This was the letter we received and they were happy for us to publish it.*

<div markdown="1" class="letter">
We are very pleased that we received approval for our planning application and believe that the decision of the planning committee vindicates the tremendous amount of research and energy we have put in to make sure that our proposal was both sympathetic in it's approach and professional in it's execution.

We aim to work hard and establish ourselves as a positive and welcome addition to the community and show through our efforts that change can indeed be for the good.

This Wine Bar has always been about creating a neighbourhood amenity where like-minded people come to meet, relax and enjoy good wine and food. It's simple really and we think that given all the other distractions in life, it's a little luxury we all deserve.

We look forward to welcoming you down to ParVinu some time in the near future.

Best wishes

Gavin, Berkley and Tony

excerpt: |
    
    Caroline Horsbrugh, a local resident, is a member of a working group of artists who graduated from Surrey Institute of Art and Design in July 2000 and exhibit under the name 'Visual Voices'.  The members of the group come from different parts of the world; India, USA, France and Barbados, but manage to communicate and exhibit together regularly, their work creatively reflecting this diversity.  As the name 'Visual Voices' suggests each artist brings to the exhibition their own voice and view of the world.

Caroline Horsbrugh, a local resident, is a member of a working group of artists who graduated from Surrey Institute of Art and Design in July 2000 and exhibit under the name 'Visual Voices'. The members of the group come from different parts of the world; India, USA, France and Barbados, but manage to communicate and exhibit together regularly, their work creatively reflecting this diversity. As the name 'Visual Voices' suggests each artist brings to the exhibition their own voice and view of the world.

Caroline lives half the year in France and her work reflects the journeying between the two countries. The [forthcoming show at the Jersey Gallery](/event/Exhibition/200604171602) in the 18th century National Trust property of Osterley Park will be a thought provoking mixture of installation, painting, print, drawing, and photography.

Don't miss [this weekend's performances](/event/Concert/200602010748) of the 2x2 Opera's 'A Very Magical Flute' at All Soul's Church.

> "This is a new and exciting adaptation of Mozart's "Magic Flute" by Keith to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth -- a young boy, refusing to practice his flute, is transported back to 1791 and finds himself in the middle of a chaotic dress rehearsal for the first performance. He meets the opera's librettist, Emanuel Schickaneder, who gives him a singing role and explains the story interwoven with extracts from the opera. The boy experiences the frenetic activity that precedes the opening night -- alongside petty jealousy's and gossip, the scenery isn't ready, neither are the costumes, the company has run out of money and Mozart hasn't actually finished the opera yet!"

The performances are on Friday 24th March at 7.30pm and Saturday 25th March at 2.30pm and 7.30pm, all at All Soul's Church, Northcote Road, St. Margarets. Tickets are £8 / £4.50 available on the door or in advance by calling 020 8891 4641.

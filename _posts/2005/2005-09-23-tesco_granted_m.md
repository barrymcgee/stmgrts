The Richmond Council has granted Tesco additional flexibility on the loading bay in front of their St Margarets Road *Tesco Express* by increasing its overall size and extending the loading time per vehicle to one hour. The details of the extension are as follows:

-   Extend the loading bay outside 135 St Margarets Road by 4.4 metres north west towards Broadway Avenue.
-   Convert remaining existing single yellow line to double yellow line (no waiting at any time) restriction.
-   Maximum stay in the new loading box to be extended to one hour.
-   Hours of operation of the loading box have been reduced to the hours of 9.30am to 4.00pm, Mondays to Saturdays.

In return, the Council has:

> "recommended that Tesco be asked to contribute to 'community initiatives' in the St Margarets area, to demonstrate their commitment to the area and act as a 'community leader'."

-- from the <a href="http://cabnet.richmond.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.asp?ID=9206">Cabinet Report <em>Tesco St Margarets<br />â€“ Amendments To The Waiting And Loading Restrictions</em></a>, September 2005

Which 'community initiatives' and Tesco's commitment to them have not been communicated yet.

Additionally, the Council claims that they will attempt to enforce the revised restrictions.

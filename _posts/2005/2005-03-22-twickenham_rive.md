After years of doing nothing, the Richmond Council has finally agreed to some _"short-term scheme"_ improvements to the Twickenham Riverside. They have approved tearing down the derelict pool building and replacing with a café, toilets and playground.

The project is well under way with the demolition complete and the construction under way.

You can learn more about it [here](http://www.rivercentre.co.uk/).

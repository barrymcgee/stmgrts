Don't forget that this Saturday, 14 July 2011, from 12 - 7.45pm, is the 34<sup>th</sup> Annual St Margarets Fair in Moormead Park.

<ul>
<li>
a full <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/schedule.html">programme</a> of entertainment throughout the day,

</li>
<li>
starting with a popular children's '5-a-side' <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/football.html">football</a> tournament in the morning on Moormead.

</li>
<li>
During the afternoon there is a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/dogshow.html">dog show</a> on little Moormead across Hillview Road.

</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/music.html">musical entertainment</a> runs all afternoon on the stage, and we moved the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/music.html">'rock'</a> from the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/food.html">rolls</a>.

</li>
<li>
There are announcements, interviews and music throughout the day from <a href="http://www.radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk/" target="_blank">Radio West Middlesex</a>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The fair organisers run the Tea Tent, Beer Tent, Pimms Stall, the BBQ, the Bric-a-brac stall, the Silent Auction, and the Coconut Shy.

</p>
<p>
All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please support these stalls. See how we spend the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/charities.html">money</a>.

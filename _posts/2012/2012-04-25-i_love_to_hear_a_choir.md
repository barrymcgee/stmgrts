excerpt: |

  Singing in choirs is good for you too - whether you are performing Handel's 'Messiah', clapping along to Gospel or pumping out some seductive 'shang-a-langs' in a doo-wop quartet. Choral singing opens the airways, develops the voice and instils confidence. Above all choir singing is fun and you don't need any experience or read music to do it. Essentially it is about joining friends to make a joyous noise - be it Bach, the Beatles or Beyonc&#233;!

Singing in choirs is good for you too - whether you are performing Handel's 'Messiah', clapping along to Gospel or pumping out some seductive 'shang-a-langs' in a doo-wop quartet. Choral singing opens the airways, develops the voice and instils confidence. Above all choir singing is fun and you don't need any experience or read music to do it. Essentially it is about joining friends to make a joyous noise - be it Bach, the Beatles or Beyoncé!

Now a new and local Community Choir is starting in St Margarets to raise that friendly, joyous noise...and the roof as well. They meet on Wednesday afternoons during term-time at All Souls Church, Northcote Rd, from 1-3pm. to sing songs from many eras and cultures including Jazz, Pop and World music. There will also be breathing and vocal exercises to help stretch and develop the voice.

The cost is £10 per session, but discounts are available. Please phone Surya on 07770 993289, or email <info@vitalvoices.co.uk>

2.  When was the iron railway bridge at Richmond built?
3.  Outside the gateway into Richmond Palace is one of the oldest pillar boxes in the world. It is called an "anonymous cylindrical". Why does it have this name?
4.  There is a sign painted on the wall of the 'Slug and Lettuce' in Richmond saying "F L 7.1.1928". What does it mean?
5.  How long does the return boat trip to Teddington Lock take?
6.  What is remarkable about the plane tree outside 'Gaucho' on Richmond Riverside?
7.  What is the name of the statue on the lawn in Buccleugh Gardens?

11. The senior surviving officer on the Titanic once lived on Ducks Walk. What was his name?
12. Between Twickenham Bridge and the railway bridge, on both sides of the river, are two brick turrets sitting on top of mounds. What do you think that they are there for?

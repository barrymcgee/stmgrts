Current Council Tax Reduction Scheme is set to cost our residents Â£3.7m a year. Richmond Council is making proposals that would require everyone of a working age (other than vulnerable claimants) to contribute at least 5% towards their Council Tax.

Currently under Richmond's Council Tax Reduction scheme, households with a low income can receive a reduction of up to a 100% of their Council Tax liability, but this depends on things like their income, savings and the size of the household.

In 2016/17, the money we get from the Government to support our services will be substantially reduced so we need to look at how we deal with this gap in funding.

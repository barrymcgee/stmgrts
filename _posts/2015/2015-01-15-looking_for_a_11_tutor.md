**DO NOT CONTACT - NO LONGER TAKING STUDENTS**

*Calling parents with children in year 4 and year 5.*

Two new group tutoring classes for 11+ exams - grammars and private schools - starts soon in central twickenham. Tutor with successful entries into Lady Eleanor Holles, Tiffin Girls, Tiffin Boys, King's College, St Catherine's and Radnor House.

My name is Anjali Ewing. I used to be a sub-editor with newspapers and magazines in London. I am now a private tutor as well as a children's yoga teacher. I have lived in the borough for 30 years.

The two separate sessions for Year 4 and Year 5 children are going to be held on a Saturday/Sunday (depending on demand) at 100 Heath Road for a maximum of eight students each. They will be tutored in English, Maths, Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning. Parents can contact me for more information and to arrange an assessment.

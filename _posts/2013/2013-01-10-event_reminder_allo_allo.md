excerpt: |

  Based on the popular TV series, the stage version of 'Allo 'Allo follows the hapless caf&#233; owner Ren&#233; as he fends off amorous waitresses, his oversexed wife, Edith (stupid woman!) and assists the escape of two dim British airmen. All this during a visit from the F&#252;hrer and while struggling to cash-in on the priceless portrait hidden in a sausage in his cellar.

  Zut alors! It's enough to make a man talk in a funny accent.

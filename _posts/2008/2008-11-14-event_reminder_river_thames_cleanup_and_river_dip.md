Help clear rubbish out of the river, learn about the history of the area and find out about the wildlife that calls the riverbed its home. Then have a go at drawing what you've found over, on and in the river.
 
With environmental teacher Joe Pecorelli and artist Emily Burton.
 
Everyone welcome. Where wellies and clothes that you don't mind getting muddy.

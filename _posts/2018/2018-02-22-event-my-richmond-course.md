My Richmond is a month-long course taking place on consecutive Saturday mornings from 24 February at Castelnau Library.

Each week we will explore a different aspect of our local history, slowly building up, a model of our local area, as well as our knowledge of the rich heritage around us. The course will look at Richmond's past and present with a fun mix of storytelling along with creative activities and games. Everyone can find a way to engage with the course at their own level so all ages are welcome.

We will provide materials, so all you need to do is show up ready to do some creative and historical exploration!

The 130-year-old, Anglo Japanese-style, Nightwatchman's Hut in Terrace Gardens, Richmond has been restored.

The hut has been repainted, with a waterproof membrane inserted under the roof to protect the historic building.

The Hut is a Grade II heritage listed building and is one of a very few of the Victorian park keeper's kiosks to survive. It was built not long after the Terrace Gardens and Buccleugh Gardens were acquired for public use, following the death of the Duke of Buccleuch. It is an unusual design and one which is more commonly seen in mainland Europe than in Britain.

Huts were traditionally used as assembly points for groups charged with watching over a particularly area during the night time.

Cllr Elengorn Cabinet Member for Environment, Planning and Sustainability said:

> "Preserving heritage buildings like this hut is an important way of giving the community an insight into how our parks and open spaces were originally managed.


> "This Hut was built when the Gardens were first opened in 1887 and sits at the top of the terraces providing a memorable view over the rest of the Gardens."

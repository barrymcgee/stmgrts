Let's Get Lost at Light Speed - new rehearsal technique piloted at RHACC

The leading edge technical research division of the Richmond Jazz School is piloting a new rehearsal technique, delivering major savings in studio costs.

Inspired by High Intensity Interval Training techniques, this revolutionary new approach means that a two hour rehearsal can be compressed in to less than two minutes.

The project is being beta tested  by four Richmond Jazz School alumni presently rehearsing for the Let's Get Lost Concert at RHACC on Saturday April 28.

Geoff Varrall (trumpet), Peter Miles (drums), Clive Brown (double bass) and Caroline Cooper (piano) also known collectively as the Retro Chet Quartet have been impressed by the efficiency  and cost savings that can be achieved.

Geoff Varrall comments

> "The concert at RHACC compresses four decades of Chet Baker studio and concert recordings (including Let's Get Lost) into two 45 minute sets.

> "This has required a radically new approach to the rehearsal process.

> "The only drawback so far has been equipment failure- Clive's double bass caught fire just after the video ended  but we remain confident that the team at RHACC can resolve these initial technical issues."

* [Book now for the concert](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lets-get-lost-the-life-and-music-of-chet-baker-tickets-43306409637) - it should be a memorable evening

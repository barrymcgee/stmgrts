Are you drinking responsibly? Keep track of your intake with the [Richmond DrinkChecker website](https://www.richmond.drinkchecker.org.uk/). Richmond's residents are being encouraged to drink responsibly and keep track of their drinking.

You can use the Council's DrinkChecker website to help set goals to drink less, see how much you can save in cash and calories by reducing your drinking, and find information about local support services.

Recent figures show over one in four adults in the borough are drinking levels of alcohol that puts them at an increased risk of alcohol-related health problems or harm.

This tool can help you be more aware about the potential damage that drinking to excess can cause.

Cllr Piers Allen, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Services and Health said:

> "As we approach the festive season, many of us will find our alcohol intake increases and it's important to be mindful of the impact on our physical health and mental well-being.


> "Alcohol Awareness Week is an opportunity to start getting into good habits early and so I encourage you to use the Council's DrinkChecker tool to remain healthy and safe over the winter months and enjoy a healthy start to the new year."

Calling local Francophiles looking to improve or perfect their French. I run friendly French conversation classes (only for adults during school hours I'm afraid) at intermediate and advanced levels.

I currently have 2 spaces, only on Monday afternoons, though there may be more availability Tues - Fri after Christmas.

There are maximum 6 students per group. Due to popular demand I have built up from 1 to 5 regular groups, who choose to look at current affairs, literature, grammar, or a mixture, all in increasingly confident French! N'oubliez pas la conversation g&#233;n&#233;rale en fran&#231;ais et l'ambiance conviviale entre amis!

Please contact me ASAP if you'd like more info or to speak to a student. I have only two spaces and must work on a first come first served basis. Premier venu, premier servi!

_Learn about IT with a cuppa and a biscuit_

Residents over 50 who are new to computers or want to pick up some new skills can come along to a series of free basic IT courses from the 19-25 September at Richmond Reference Library.

'ITea and Biscuits' is an event coordinated by Age UK designed to give older residents the opportunity to learn to use computers at a 'taster session', all attendees will also be given a cup of tea and a biscuit.

The classes will cover beginner's computer skills, using the internet, Facebook and email.

Cllr Pamela Fleming, Richmond Council Cabinet Member for Community, Business and Culture, said:

> "Richmond Reference Library already provides comprehensive computer taster sessions for all residents - whether you are a complete beginner, need to refresh your knowledge, or just want to know what the Internet is all about.
>
> "These new taster sessions are a great, informal, way for people with little or no experience of technology to get a taste of the whole new world that can be opened up by accessing and understanding the internet .Then, if you enjoy the course, maybe consider signing up for another course in the wider programme."

Sandra Morrison CEO, Age UK Richmond added

> "This is a wonderful free opportunity for people over 50 to improve their IT skills or indeed learn a new skillto help them make the best of today's technology. Having access tocomputer training is hugely important and there are many benefits to be gained from keeping in touch with friends and family, to maintaining independence through internet banking and shopping online."

> As well as encouraging people to attend local events, this year Age UK is calling on people who already know how to use technology to pass on their knowledge to an older friend, family member or neighbour and become a Digital Champion.

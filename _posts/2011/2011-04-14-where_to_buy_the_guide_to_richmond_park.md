excerpt: |
  "The new <a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2011/03/the_friends_publish_the_first_guide_book_to_richmo.html">Guide to Richmond Park</a> we've just published is selling like hot cakes with re-orders from practically all the bookshops in the area we've supplied to.  A great thing for bookshops is that the Guide is NOT available on Amazon  so they're doing very well with sales.  It would be good if you can to give a mention to <a href="http://www.langtonsbookshop.com/,">Langton's</a> the indie bookshop, in (Church Street) Twickenham to say the Guide is available.

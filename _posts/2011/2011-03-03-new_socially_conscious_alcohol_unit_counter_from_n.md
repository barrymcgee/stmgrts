Tiffin Girls' School has a Young Enterprise company called Nova and they are about to launch a new product called 'unit', an innovative alcohol unit counter. It will be available for people to buy from local stores or directly from their website.

> Unit: it's sleek and perfectly discreet; a pocket sized dial that allows the user to effectively keep count of their units.

Young Enterprise is a registered charity that aims to try and forge links between businesses and schools. In effect, it's a competition whereby many different companies comprising of 6<sup>th</sup> form students from schools across the country are created; each company must create their own product for retail sale, and there are different regional heats before the final later on in the year.

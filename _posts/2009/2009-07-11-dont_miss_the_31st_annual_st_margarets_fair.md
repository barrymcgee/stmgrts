*This year the Fair will be on Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> July starting at 12.00*

<a href="/assets/images/2009/smf_map09.pdf">Here is a map of the fairground (pdf).</a>

<p>
There will be a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/schedule.html">full programme</a> of entertainment throughout the day, starting with a popular children's '5-a-side' <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/football.html">football</a> tournament in the morning on Moormead.

During the afternoon there is a <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/dogshow.html">dog show</a> on little Moormead across Hillview Road.

The <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/music.html">musical</a> entertainment will run all afternoon on the stage, and we're moving the stage further away from the tea tent to help separate the 'rock' from the rolls.

There will be announcements, interviews and music throughout the day from <a href="http://www.radiowestmiddlesex.org.uk/">Radio West Middlesex</a>.

The fair organisers run the Tea Tent, Beer Tent, Pimms Stall, Greek Food, the BBQ, the Bric-a-brac stall, a Plant stall, the Silent Auction, and the Coconut Shy.

All profits from these stalls go direct to our charities - please support these stalls. Look on our plan of the <a href="/assets/images/2009/smf_map09.pdf" target="_blank">fair ground</a> to find where they are. See how we spend the <a href="http://www.stmargaretsfair.org/pages/charities.html">money</a>.

Every year volunteers organise and staff the following:

-   The BBQ is run by parents from <a href="http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/richmond/schools/ois/">Orleans Infant School's PTA â€“ FOOI</a>.
-   Local parents organise a Pimms stall from <a href="http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/richmond/schools/op/">Orleans Park School.</a>
-   Site stewarding is done by the parents of children at <a href="http://www.st-stephens.richmond.sch.uk/index.html">St Stephens Junior School</a>, and an early morning team is on site from 7am to help stall holders.
-   The fair site is kept clean by parents at <a href="http://www.st-marys.richmond.sch.uk/">St Mary's CE School</a> who clean up throughout the day and on the Sunday morning.

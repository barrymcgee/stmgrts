    In October 2008, the Council extended the St Margarets South CPZ to Bridge Road and Winchester Road. The decision to extend the CPZ followed consultation with residents and businesses in the area, the results of which were reported to the Council's Transport Consultative Group (TCG) last June. <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/parking/controlled_parking_zones/controlled_parking_zone_consultations/st_margarets_cpz_review.htm">The Council is now reviewing the operation of this CPZ extension.</a>

In October 2008, the Council extended the St Margarets South CPZ to Bridge Road and Winchester Road. The decision to extend the CPZ followed consultation with residents and businesses in the area, the results of which were reported to the Council's Transport Consultative Group (TCG) last June. [The Council is now reviewing the operation of this CPZ extension.](http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/transport_and_streets/motor_vehicles_roads_and_parking/parking/controlled_parking_zones/controlled_parking_zone_consultations/st_margarets_cpz_review.htm)

The purpose of the review is to seek the views of the residents and businesses within the extended CPZ on how it has worked since its implementation, whether it should remain in operation and, if so, whether any changes to it should be taken forward.

As part of the review, residents and businesses situated in roads outside the CPZ which were consulted in May 2008 are being consulted again to see whether they would wish to have the CPZ further extended to include their road. The decision to re-consult this area follows requests made at the TCG meeting last June.

The deadline for return of completed questionnaire and comments is Monday 20 April 2009.

The results of the consultation will be reported to a meeting of the Transport Consultative Group (TCG) on Wednesday 20 May 2009 starting at 6.30pm at York House, Twickenham, following which a decision will be made on the way forward. The meeting of the TCG is open to the public and the agenda and report are available on our website 7 days before the date of the meeting. Anyone wishing to speak at the TCG meeting will need to register on 020 8891 7156 before 2pm on Tuesday 19 May 2009. Minutes of the meeting will be available on the Council website and on request.

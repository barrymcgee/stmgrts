[Nearly four years ago I wrote a post on comments, spam and a recommended etiquette for this site](/archives/2005/12/on_comments.html) that I still believe is the right balance for creating an open forum with some accountability. Admittedly, this is a difficult balance between encouraging people to speak freely and post easily and preventing unhelpful and unwanted remarks. So I would like to reiterate the following:

-   **Use your real name** where possible. If you cannot for whatever reason, use the same pseudonym consistently so it doesn't appear that you are an angry mob.
-   **Use you real email address** at all times *it isn't published*, but let's me know you are a real person.

Remember, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.

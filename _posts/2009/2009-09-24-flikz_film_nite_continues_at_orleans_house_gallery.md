Flikz is aimed at young people between 12 and 19, and is a great activity taking place on the last Wednesday of every month from 6:00 to 8.30: and the next one will take place next Wednesday 30<sup>th</sup> September .

It is completely free, and there will be snacks for those attending. The idea is to give young people the opportunity to meet in a safe environment after school, and enjoy a film. This month's choice is:-

The Stables Gallery will remain open until 8:30, and we are currently showcasing Ashley Davies: 'Without Words' A new body of work with urban imagery as the starting point and those attending FLIKZ can view this show.

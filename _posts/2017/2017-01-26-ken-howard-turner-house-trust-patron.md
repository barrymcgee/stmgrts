Turner's House Trust has announced artist Professor Ken Howard OBE RA as a new patron of the Trust.

"Ken Howard has been a generous supporter of the Trust's project to restore Sandycombe Lodge for a number of years and it is with great pleasure that we announce his acceptance of our invitation to become a patron," said Catherine Parry-Wingfield, Turner's House Trust chairman.

"Ken is one of the best-known contemporary British artists, and his long admiration for JMW Turner led him to follow Turner's journeys through Switzerland, resulting in over 100 oil paintings and a magnificent record in his book Ken Howard in Switzerland: in Turner's Footsteps."

"Ken said with characteristic modesty that he was 'honoured' to be asked. We are greatly honoured that he has accepted," Catherine added.

Local, independent retail businesses are invited to find out how they can become better connected and digitally enabled at the very first 'High Street Leaders' Conference later this month.

The event, at Richmond Adult Community College on the 25 September, has been organised by SaveTheHighStreet.org. - a national campaigning organisation coordinating and industry-wide movement to promote a better connected, digitally enabled and more sustainable high street. It aims to bring together local retailers, councils and business improvement districts to look at how they can adapt in a digital world.

The event will include presentations from global companies Google and Facebook. They will be sharing firsthand insights into the future of the high street.

> "The conference gives our business owners a great opportunity to learn from the best digital companies in the world including Google and Facebook and I urge them to take advantage of the opportunity.

> "There will also be a chance to participate in a range of workshops, including a focus on the first ever retailer-led 'High Street Industry Standards."

Cllr Gareth Elliot, Cabinet Member for Digital and Technology said:

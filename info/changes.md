Just to share what we are doing on the site we are sharing a _change log_ of all the 'major' changes to the site.  Initially we will put in only a few key dates as there were many minor changes.  Going forward, I will add more minor details.


| Date                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 16 November 2010            | Wrote a [traffic parser](/cgi-bin/get_traffic.cgi) using TFL, not sure if I will make it more public                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 20 October 2010             | re-wrote scrapers for Richmond Theatre, Twickfolk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13 October 2010             | re-launched mystmargarets.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2 October 2010              | Expanded directory to share listings with mystmargarets, and add 'I love St Margarets' to listings if in Traders' Association                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11 May 2007                 | Moved directory and events to database from a flat-file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19 March 2006               | Moved polls, events and directory to mod_rewrite URLS that are cleaner and more logical.  Also added embeded google maps to single directory listing pages... however, I have to fetch a google map to get the lat/long first, so might prove to be too slow.                                                                                    |
| 17 March 2006               | Added mod_rewrite to make events urls look _nicer_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 14 March 2006               | Changed the homepage to show 2 full stories and 12 except versions of stories to allow 6 more stories on the homepage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 2 February 2006             | Added a larger footer to un-clutter the homepage more and add important links to the rest of the sites pages.  Also created a main [archive page](/archives.html)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 5 December 2005             | Added javascript to show/hide list of hot items... the list had grown too long.  Hopefully it "degrades" nicely as its based on Jeremy Keith's DOMScripting ideas.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1 December 2005             | Added three month Tesco Bay Observation pages.  Its the first use of MySQL and PHP on the site.  Seems to work fine... I might need to convert the Events and Directory to this...                                                                                                                                                               |
| 17 November 2005            | Created new action in poll.cgi to allow for direct 150x150 viewing of the current poll results, created an include version of gd_pie to do this                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16 November 2005            | Added flag to allow inactive polls to appear in polls list, just without the option to vote                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21 October 2005             | Converted homepage to shtml so no more publishing events each morning, it updates itself... since I was doing that, I moved to a new weather widget that I wrote using METAR data, moved to background image for bullet chevron, so IE users can see it too and (finally) added the 'Hot Items' section to keep important topics on the homepage |
| 11 October 2005             | Converted homepage events lists to new [hCalendar format](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) just in case this becomes popular... or even useful.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 27 September 2005           | Added a _print_ style sheet that makes links visible and gets rid of unnecessary information (e.g. navigation, footer, etc...)                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21 September 2005           | Lowered the limit again on polls to 2 per IP and added javascript warning to that affect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18 September 2005           | Made the site 80 pixels wider to give more breathing room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 15 September 2005           | Added a check to make sure people cannot abuse the [polls](/cgi-bin/poll.cgi) as easily                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4 July 2005                 | Added images to the event application.  Also, retaining expired events in case anyone bookmarks them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29 June 2005                | To the event application, added 'kids' as a flag for events, so it can be any type AND kids.  Also added 'host' entity so that groups can host an event at another venue and it will show up for both directory listings                                                                                                                         |

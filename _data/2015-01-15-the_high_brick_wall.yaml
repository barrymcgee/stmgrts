    <p>I too was a former resident from the ages of 5 to 13. I don&#39;t recognise at all the place you describe. Which people "that worked in the Red House" told you there was not much laughter behind the wall? I remember lots of laughter while living there. So much in fact that kids from school would come and play in the grounds everyday rather than local parks etc. Check your facts about abuse too. While the Sisters of Nazareth as an organisation faced allegations of abuse in SOME homes (mainly in Ireland), Isleworth had no allegations at all. I was there in the 1970s so would have remembered you Steve Porter. Never heard of you mate. A smacked bum now and again or told to stay at the table until you ate your dinner wasn&#39;t really abuse was it? Don&#39;t pretend it was. But then as I said, I don&#39;t remember anyone with your name.</p>

    <p>I recollect a tragic incident in (I think) the fifties, or very early sixties, when apparently the river had flooded so high that an elderly person was drowned in their flat in Twickenham.  I was under the impression at the time, that it was in a basement flat in Richmond Bridge Mansions.</p>

    <p>I well remember that smell of malt and hops as I would accompany my grandfather, helping to push his hand cart  to his allotment opposite the brewery  in St John&#39;s road . My grandparents lived in a house the grandfather had built in Newton Road. He was a retired builder and  kept pigeons. my parents were married  (as was I ) in St. John&#39;s church I don&#39;tv do god anymore, but the brewery YES. I have just bought on ebay a crown cork, Isleworth ales bottle opener, hence the memory recall</p>

    <p>I used to cycle daily along the Crane, and have seen these shy, beautiful birds in a number of places on the river, in a short, looping flight, with a flash of metallic blue green, or perching above the river and diving for small fish.  Places include Harlequins car park, on a quiet morning, and the stretches from Mill Lane, up to Hospital Bridge.</p>

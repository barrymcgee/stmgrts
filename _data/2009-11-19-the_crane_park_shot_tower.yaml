    <p>I wish that the correct history of the Tower in Crane Park would be published. It is NOT a Shot Tower. (For a start you most certainly would not have a Shot Tower in a Gunpowder Mill complex. As the fire risk would be too great. Secondly it is the wrong shape and not tall enough to be a Shot Tower) It is in fact a Windmill. Being one of two surviving windmill remains in the old county of Middlesex. Interestingly both of these mills were built to pump water. The Crane Park Mill was built to pump water out of the River Crane below the waterwheels of the gunpowder mills. It surved two purposes. 1) To pump water back above the waterwheels. So that it could be reused in times of water shortages. 2) To pump water up to a higher level reservoir/tank as an emergency supply etc etc. It was believed to have been built early in the 19th Century. The mill has five sails and powered a Scoop-wheel (If you inspect the base of the Tower you can clearly see the remains of the leat (now filled in) were the Scoop-Wheel was situated. Also you can see the hole in the Tower through which the Scoop-Wheel shaft exited the mill tower (The stone baring is also present) Another feature present is the evidence in the Tower  of the position of the &#39;Reefing Stage&#39; which allowed the Miller to adjust the sails. Finally it is worth noting that Charles Dickens the great 19th Century novelist visited The Gunpowder Mill Complex and describes the windmill in considerable detail!</p>

    <p>My Grandfather was living in Richmond after fleeing the War, they met and my Grandmother and he married but my Great Grandmother "Hated him" Sorry such harsh words, but he would have to stand in the road to speak to my Grandmother. My Grandfather was Charles Bernard Frerot, born in Leige and served in the Belgium Army at  Fort d&#39;&#201;vegn&#233;e. I would be be very interested in any information regarding this.</p>

    <p>Hello,</p>  <p>I am doing research on people from my home town Dendermonde (Appels, Baasrode, Dendermonde, Grembergen, Mespelare, Oudegem, Schoonaarde and Sint-Gillis-Dendermonde) who fled to England during WWI. Could you please help me finding these people in the East Twickenham-Richmond area?</p>  <p>Thank you,</p>  <p>JP</p>

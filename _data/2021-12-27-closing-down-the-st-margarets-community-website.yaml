    <p>I am sorry you are ceasing.  I have recommended the site to many for Items you read nowhere else.  Example recent open day for Poppy Factory. You will be missed &#x1F622;</p>

    <p>Really  very sad to read this. The site gave me a sense of community that I have not experienced in the UK since my arrival. I found the site in 2014 and have felt a member of "the shire" ever siince.</p>  <p>Good luck and God bless in all your future endeavours.</p>

    <p>I will really miss the site. I lived in St Margarets and went to St Stephens School. I often plan a trip to see my Mum and we have often attended activities you have spotlighted. And together chatted about your posts, even as recently as last week, the clip about the River Crane. Thank you for the 16 years!</p>

    <p>Sorry to read this Peter but completely understandable as I am sure it has been a serious drain on your time. Well done on the fabulous work you have done over so many years for the community and I am sure many many thousands have benefitted from the newsletters and all the informative and fun stuff included and the sense of community it has created. Many thanks.</p>

    <p>Having lived in St Margarets for 3 years in the 80s, this was a great re-connection with the village. Thanks for all your work! You will be missed!</p>

    <p>First of all, thank you for the wonderful comments and emails, they mean a lot.  Secondly, on reading this post, Martyn Day contacted me and asked if he could get one more article published.  I have agreed.</p>  <p><a href="https://stmargarets.london/archives/2021/12/mentioned-in-despatches.html">Mentioned in despatches</a></p>

    <p>Ummmm. . . So what would be your thoughts/response to the fact that a book titled &#39;The Memoirs of Billy Shears&#39; with Sir Paul McCartney&#39;s involvement including copyrighted lyrics (which would have required permission) has been released and went through three different versions revealing more info about how it all went down?</p>

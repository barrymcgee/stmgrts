    <p>Thank you for supplying this information. I am a descendant of Ann&#39;s second husband John Tolson, a London merchant. John&#39;s will was made in 1720, having married Ann in 1714. John&#39;s will was proved in 1736. John indicates in his will that he had previously given money to his son, also John (a clock maker), and daughter, Edith and concludes by saying  &#39;I have straitened myself and my poor and loving wife of a competent and necessary subsistence and livelihood&#39; which gives an explanation of how Ann came to be so indigent. Caleb Cotesworth was a London surgeon who came from a well-to-do family in Northumberland. However the origin of his great wealth was probably from his interests in the East India Company of which he was a director. Ann was a first cousin of Caleb&#39;s wife Susannah through their respective mothers who were sisters (Reeve). Fortuitously for Ann, Susannah had no issue, siblings or parents so the 3 surviving 1<sup>st</sup> cousins, as the nearest living relatives, got the entire residue of Caleb&#39;s estate. Ann Newton&#39;s father George was &#39;of Duffield&#39;, but Ann herself was born and baptised on 23rd February 1661 at St Augustine&#39;s church, Watling Street, London. There is an entry about the Newton family in Burke&#39;s landed gentry. If you do have any family information about Ann Tolson / Dash - I would be very pleased to hear from you. I have spent some time researching Ann&#39;s family, so I&#39;d be happy to tell you more, should you be interested. Kind regards Nick Moss</p>

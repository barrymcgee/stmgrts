    <p>I&#39;ve just had the same thing happen to me. Two calls one from John giving me a 6 figure number and asking the same questions, the second from a Micheal going over the questions and saying l&#39;ll receive another call tomorrow telling me how much l&#39;ll get, he also asked if l had l.d. as l would need this for the cheque and what l.d. l&#39;d be using. I thought this has to be a scam, and found your message. Thanks. I didn&#39;t catch the 1<sup>st</sup> number, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> was 01384410370.</p>

    <p>I have had exactly the same this week everyday for the last 4 days. On every call I have told them I&#39;m not interested and put the phone down but still they try again. They don&#39;t appear to take the rather unsubtle hint.</p>

    <p>I have had the same calls for the last few weeks now telling me I&#39;m owed compensation from the Government regarding my PPI Claim and that and I&#39;m entitled to between &pound;3,500 - &pound;5,000  - they then go through all the usual scripted notes - the first/second time they rang I did half believe them as they had my name and previous address that I lived - the first phone call they went on to say that the only way I could have the full amount is if had some investment plan in place like life insurance, funeral plan, savings etc. which I said I hadn&#39;t - don&#39;t worry I will put you through to my colleague who can sort a life insurance policy for you and before the first payment is taken out cancel the policy - they then said please don&#39;t tell anyone about this which at the time I thought was a bit dodgy - when they went to transfer me to sort out taking a life insurance policy out i put the phone down - they must ring me from different mobile numbers once maybe twice a week - I received another call yesterday let him go through it all - then said to him I need to check this out as this might not be legitimate to which he gave me the following phone no. 0161 8261 725 (i haven&#39;t rang it) and confirmed he was from Claims Advisory Group and told me his name was Steve Roger bearing in mind please excuse me I&#39;m not being derogatory but he was Indian - reading all your comments I shall certainly be reporting this</p>

    <p>Got a call saying I was owed &pound;3600 as a result of excessive bank  charges levied in the past. The caller was called Donald with a very very thick Indian Accent, very hard to understand. He said you will be contacted with full details by his supervisor. This guy was pretty easy to understand, and he said that I had to go to Morrisons or Tesco and purchase a Google Playcard to the value of &pound;200 and a Mr Robinson would would come  later to my home, I would handover the Playcard and then receive a cheque for &pound;3600. So I contacted police on 101 and was told they had been inundated with calls about this. Well as expected Mr Robinson did not appear,I did not of course buy Playcard,but wonder has anybody fallen for this scam. Nick.</p>

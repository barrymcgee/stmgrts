    <p>I&#39;ve just had the same thing happen to me. Two calls one from John giving me a 6 figure number and asking the same questions, the second from a Micheal going over the questions and saying l&#39;ll receive another call tomorrow telling me how much l&#39;ll get, he also asked if l had l.d. as l would need this for the cheque and what l.d. l&#39;d be using. I thought this has to be a scam, and found your message. Thanks. I didn&#39;t catch the 1<sup>st</sup> number, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> was 01384410370.</p>

    <p>I have had exactly the same this week everyday for the last 4 days. On every call I have told them I&#39;m not interested and put the phone down but still they try again. They don&#39;t appear to take the rather unsubtle hint.</p>

    <p>I have had the same calls for the last few weeks now telling me I&#39;m owed compensation from the Government regarding my PPI Claim and that and I&#39;m entitled to between &pound;3,500 - &pound;5,000  - they then go through all the usual scripted notes - the first/second time they rang I did half believe them as they had my name and previous address that I lived - the first phone call they went on to say that the only way I could have the full amount is if had some investment plan in place like life insurance, funeral plan, savings etc. which I said I hadn&#39;t - don&#39;t worry I will put you through to my colleague who can sort a life insurance policy for you and before the first payment is taken out cancel the policy - they then said please don&#39;t tell anyone about this which at the time I thought was a bit dodgy - when they went to transfer me to sort out taking a life insurance policy out i put the phone down - they must ring me from different mobile numbers once maybe twice a week - I received another call yesterday let him go through it all - then said to him I need to check this out as this might not be legitimate to which he gave me the following phone no. 0161 8261 725 (i haven&#39;t rang it) and confirmed he was from Claims Advisory Group and told me his name was Steve Roger bearing in mind please excuse me I&#39;m not being derogatory but he was Indian - reading all your comments I shall certainly be reporting this</p>

    <p>Got a call saying I was owed &pound;3600 as a result of excessive bank  charges levied in the past. The caller was called Donald with a very very thick Indian Accent, very hard to understand. He said you will be contacted with full details by his supervisor. This guy was pretty easy to understand, and he said that I had to go to Morrisons or Tesco and purchase a Google Playcard to the value of &pound;200 and a Mr Robinson would would come  later to my home, I would handover the Playcard and then receive a cheque for &pound;3600. So I contacted police on 101 and was told they had been inundated with calls about this. Well as expected Mr Robinson did not appear,I did not of course buy Playcard,but wonder has anybody fallen for this scam. Nick.</p>

    <p>I received a call today from a foul mouthed individual. When I asked her not to phone this number again (we have been phoned several times every day for sometime now) as it was a scam, she let loose with an attack of some of the worse swearing I have heard in some time and then accused me of wasting her time and that I would have to answer to Jesus.  Theses creatures have now sunk to an all time low.</p>

    <p>today 16-10-19 had the same two calls as in above mentioned article.asking for personnel details to be confirmed, about which they already held, so as to give you money on behalf of the government, due to the improprieties of any financial bodies you yourself may have had dealings with over the past "twenty years". on receiving the second call i was told i would receive another call from "micheal"this time in regards to how much the cheque amount they would be sending me was and so on. having read the article above before i got the second call "i smelled a rat". I called the number given at the end of the article 08000279592 and drew a blank , no longer in use. so i then went onto call the ACTION FRAUD line 03001239592 to report what was obviously an ongoing repeat  SCAM being sold.  they were very helpful and attentive with good advice to follow up. a long long wait to get through.  when the second  call came through again" john"went through some basic repeated details ,at which point i cut him short, and asked" do i have to pay you money before you pay me", he responded with" WHAT"! I  then told him that i had reported them to the fraud office and hung up. still two or more years down the line there are a group of asian fraudsters claiming to be working on behalf on the government/ hmrc in the manchester area, please be very aware. if government were to refund monies to you they would write to you on official headed letters stating the reasons why and the amount you would be awarded. adjustments to your exsisting accounts security advisable. brian entwistle 16-10-2019, 1716hrs.</p>

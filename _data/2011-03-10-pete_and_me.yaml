    <p>Oh Martyn !!   you so elequently bring back those great days.   I remember you  coming to our house on a Saturday afternoon where l fed you all before you went off to your gig.   |I even made your first jerkins which you wore on your first gigs.   You soon  discarded them for your madras striped jackets.  You were such a good looking group of boys with no hang ups, you just loved playing your music and loving all the attention the girls gave you.   I still have all the records  with Trekkas scrawled across the covers which belonged to my son Michael Casey who you all called Mick, who is sadly no longer with us.  I still think that the music of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s cannot be beaten. One of your opening numbers was "Walking the dog.   another favourite was "The house of the Rising Sun".   I am95 now but my memory of those days has never faded.   When I can&#39;t sleep at  night I listen to the radio and occasionally I find a station that plays music of that era - and I am away.  I remember all the records they play. Lovely nostalgia..</p>  <p>Kathy Casey</p>

    <p>I took the first 2 pence on the bridge, my father went to school with Micky Snapper and supplied the turn styles. I took the first money while they installed them, I was seven years old and became confused when asked for change as it was an expression I was unfamiliar with. I remember the hotel dance floor was fully sprung and spent some time bouncing up and down on it.</p>

    <p>I was part of the Twickenham Sea Cadet Guard of Honour at the opening of the Bridge and I also did the Scripture Reading which was part of the Ceremony on the Embankment.  I wonder if anyone has any photos?</p>

    <p>My Father New Michael Snapper back in the 1960&#39;s &amp; used to do business with him. I think we bought a Table Tennis Table from him. He used to live in a Big house on Kingston Hill which backed on to Richmond Park near to Ladder Style Gate, I remember going there one time with my Father. My friends &amp; I started going to Eel Pie Island in the days when The Rolling Stones played there once a week, I think it was in 1963 &amp; I was at College. They had not become famous then &amp; we use to see them for a few Bob entry to the Club. There were  lots of great R&amp;B bands playing then before they became really well known &amp; moved on to bigger venues! There was also a great Club in Kingston called The Cellar Club &amp; many of the Bands that were at Eel Pie moved on to there. Memorably The Yardbirds, The Pretty things &amp; others. They were great days &amp; we will never be able to see those times again when you could experience the best Bands around for a few bob!</p>

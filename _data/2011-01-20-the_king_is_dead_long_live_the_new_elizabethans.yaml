    <p>I was also 7 years old attending Richard Cobden, Camden Town,  just down the road from Tufnell Park.  I still have my book, in great condition, and can remember being lined up along Hampstead Road, flags in hand, to wave to Queen Elizabeth 11 as she drove past us. Seems like yesterday! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this piece, it brought back many memories of life in Camden Town.</p>

    <p>My goodness your article brought back memories. Do you remember this one:</p>  <p>Just a song at twilight, When the lights are low And the flickering shadows Softly come and go</p>  <p>I think it ends up with something about love&#39;s old sweet song, but I&#39;ve forgotten most of it.  And of course there&#39;s My old man, said follow the van, and don&#39;t dilly dally on the way... And. Come into the garden Maud.  My father used to sing these when he was shaving. How he didn&#39;t cut himself I&#39;ll never know...,</p>

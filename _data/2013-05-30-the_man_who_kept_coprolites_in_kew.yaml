    <p>I  have only  just read of J E&#39;s crossing the Rainbow bridge. Jungle made a Runic Ring invoking the  power of the Runes.</p>  <p>Edred Thorsen beheld the craftsmanship and declared &#39; this man knows his stuff&#39;.</p>  <p>Sadly the world is all the more poorer for Jungle Eyes passing.  However a few of us had our lives enriched during his time amongst us.</p>

    <p>I bought an Altered States (of consciousness) ring back in 1988 on his stall on the South Bank I loved that ring. Some 3 years later Jungle came rushing over to me saying "Take off the ring... look at you!" He pointed to a woman in a mirror, me! How I had changed, from a run of the mill housewife into a shaman/hippy/rune reader in 3 years and I hadn&#39;t even realised how much I has altered. The ring was put away only to come out for readings.. No one could say Jungle&#39;s wares did not work. Jungle was a special man who touched all he met I was one of the lucky ones who did meet him, belated condolences to friends and family xx</p>

    <p>I know that my post is very late but I have only just seen this.</p>  <p>I was a great friend of his at Harrow and was expelled before I was 15.  We spent much time together and in fact I first wrote to the Chinese Embassy and received around 20 of Mao&#39;s Red books which I sold for 10/- each so that I could buy cigarettes.</p>  <p>We used to lie on our backs on the grass on one of the playing fields, looking at the sky and smoking a cigarette with a smile on our faces, and, from time to time, saying "Skyyyyyyyyy!"</p>  <p>Yes, I know, a little strange, but I wanted to add this as I have never forgotten him and always wondered what became of him</p>

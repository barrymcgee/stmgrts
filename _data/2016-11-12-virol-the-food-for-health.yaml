    <p>Virol was great, my mother "doled it out" as a treat when my sister and I were "convalescing" from Whooping Cough or Mumps (no MMR in those days). Don&#39;t remember being given at school though. But Martyn is right that no-one seemed to have allergies. Except I do recall one - just one.  At the Christmas school party, about 1960, the teacher suddenly remembered we had a boy with Diabetes in the class and announced to the entire room (50 children + helping adults) that he couldn&#39;t have the usual cake, jelly &amp; ice-cream etc.  His solution for this mortified 9 year old?  "Find him some fruit!" Maybe we were healthier then (no multi-billion food &amp; drink industry advertising on colour telly) but teachers are now certainly better informed and more sensitive.</p>

    <p>I remember Virol especially as my parents had a pharmacy.  We didn&#39;t get it at school although we did get 1/3 pint of milk, which was never in the fridge so it was warm in the summer (eugh!) and frozen in winter (more eugh!).  Interesting history above because Beecham (who produced Horlicks) purchased Bovril, Marmite &amp; Ambrosia from Cavenham Foods.  The company was sold on again to CPC in 1990. My parents used to give us Minadex if we were recovering from colds, cough, tonsilitis etc. and Lucozade with that beautifully  orange cellophaned wrapped bottle.  Rosehip syrup was also popular in the 60s - another very sweet syrup which was good for us and we believed them - a spoonful of sugar and all that!</p>

    <p>I must have gone to the same primary school as Martyn Day in Tufnell Park, I agree we were given a spoonful of Virol every week by a woman, thought she was the nurse. We used to queue up in the corridor by class, and it cost a penny. I loved it.  You were right, we all seemed healthier then. We were also given syrup of figs to keep us regular (normally after bath time on a Friday). Also Liquid Frutta, for coughs, tasted awful.</p>

    <p>My mother told me that she put Virol on my dummy and was convinced that the sticky sweet stuff was responsible for my baby teeth dropping out or needing to be extracted!! Beware&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;&eth;&#159;&#152;</p>

    <p>Yes, I remember those times well.  My favourites in my childhood were Virol by the spoonful, wonderful.  Also Nestle&#39;s Milk (which was a sweet sticky fluid which came in a white tin) spread on a slice of bread.  Delicious!  I also remember as a child exploring an empty house which my father had bought and finding a large unlabelled tin (probably about 2kg size) of a brown powder, which we tasted.  My sister didn&#39;t like it, but I could not get enough of it.  It turned out to be instant coffee, which I had never seen before, and must explain why these days I am addicted to espresso.....</p>

    <p>I am confused.   Some say Virol was a meat product others say malt extract.  Who is correct?  Loved Virol.  I buy malt extract but has not the same depth of flavor.</p>

    <p>I lived in Tufnell Park too from &#39;57 to &#39;67. Adored virol, couldn&#39;t get enough of it. Also rosehip syrup and haliborange vitamin pills. I can hear the squeak of the wrapper on the bottle of lucozade. If I had a temperature mum would carefully open the paper wrapper containing a Beecham&#39;s powder and dissolve it in water. You drank it down as fast as possible then got the lucozade to take away the taste. Survived measles, German measles, mumps, chicken pox, pneumonia - we were made of stern stuff then, and I reckon virol had a lot to do with it.</p>

    <p>I was born in 1951 and although i dont remember being given Virol my mum told me she used to dip my dummy in it. Although she took me to the dentist regularly it did not prevent my second teeth coming through decayed, I also recall having to have several baby teeth extracted. Im convinced the Virol accounted for this happening, through very assiduous care and good dentistry I have most of my natural teeth still, though many are filled, capped, crowned etc. Thank goodness for advances in dentistry but had I not been given Virol this way I feel my oral health wouldnt have suffered in the way it has.</p>

    <p>We, too, disliked Virol and called it Vile, although we didn&#39;t get it at school. Loved NH orange juice concentrate. The place we got it also housed the school dentist, which still used gas as an anesthetic. National Milk tins we kept jigsaws in. Loved the school milk. We could get extra ones in break time, as there was always a surplus. The only time I liked Lucozade was when I was ill and it was often the only thing I felt like. Survived chicken pox and measles, epidemics of which followed each other within a month, and mumps later, good to get over at an early age. We had stool samples collected from home during them. Lots of good plain food, including school dinners. All those milk puddings - Rice, semolina, sago and tapioca. We grew up to be taller than our parents. In my 6<sup>th</sup> form almost all the boys were six footers.</p>

    <p>I was very thin after measles as a child though looking at me now it&#226;&#128;&#153;s hard to believe. Was put on this by my mother and loathed it to the point I hid the jar inside a large vase. Was promised it would be my last jar if I told her where it was, I did and it was. Hated taste,smell and sound as the spoon came out with the brown goo Along with parishes food, fennings and Virol we had a good time and kids moan now</p>

    <p>I found this while trying to source Virol. It seems that this is no longer obtainable. The various malt extracts from H&amp;B are nowhere near as good. This is a product we were given in the &#226;&#128;&#152;50s and I miss, along with... Haliborange little round tablets Woodward&#226;&#128;&#153;s Gripe Water - better than gin Rosehip syrup</p>

    <p>Yes, I remember &#39;Virol&#39; in the early 1950&#39;s. Then it came in a swollen-topped glass jar with a tin lid which also had a tin circlip around it, I think, like those on paste jars of the same period. I remember that I liked it in those days. Several years ago I found an original &#39;pot/china&#39; jar of the same shape in an antiques&#39; shop. I still have it in my study ! I now see that H &amp; B stock the modern equivalent; it will be interesting to taste some as, of course, our taste changes over time. I remember how I disliked peanut butter as a child but love it now !</p>

    <p>I remember being given Virol as a child living in London during the 1960s, but definitely not at school.  I absolutely loved the stuff and remember being given spoonfuls of it.  Mum sometimes put Virol in hot milk to drink and she also used it as a sandwich spread.</p>

    <p>Sitting with my friend discussing memories of Virol. We were born 1943 and 1947. Both of us it turns out were brought up on daily Virol and we loved it. We had the /3 pt milk at school daily, National Health Orange and Cod Liver Oil which I can still drink from the bottle. We are now going to try some Malt Extract products, starting with a visit to Holland &amp; Barrett. Thanks for the memories</p>

    <p>Both I and my sister had Virol in the mid 1930&#39;s. We obtained it from a local centre in the High Road, Ilford. It was supplied in waxed cartons and we took it both from the spoon and also spread on bread and butter-delicious! From the same centre we also had Emulsion and taken on the spoon -again very nice. I was a fairly sickly child and am coming up to 90! my sister is a year older. I still have a few teeth and so does my sister - and she still manages on her own. Maybe we both have a lot to thank  Virol and Emulsion for and my Mother for keeping us well. A last comment is that Virol was not seen at school.</p>

    <p>I was supplemented with Virol in the 1940s.  Many decades later my mother told me it "saved me from being a wimp." !  (Not her exact words, but you get the message.)  It would be interesting to know what its ingredients were then.</p>

    <p>I loved Virol! Given a spoon full most days at home in 50&#39;s. Also took minadex which I loved the taste of as well. Never really thought about what was in either supplement. Was talking to a friend about it the other day then someone posted an old newspaper &amp; there was an advert for Virol. Not with a young lad in though :-) I have luckily been healthy all my life &amp; have all but a couple of my own teeth with only about 4 fillings so it didn&#39;t do my teeth any harm but it&#39;s probably different if on a dummy, which my Mum didn&#39;t use.</p>

    <p>I was interested to read that Bovril were the originators of Virol. However, in the 1960s I lived with my parents in an old house in Aston Clinton , Buckinghamshire. Local legend had  it that a doctor "who invented Virol" had lived there at some time. Digging in the garden one day we unearthed a very old Virol jar, which I still have, although that could have been just a co-incidence!</p>

    <p>I loved Virol as a child (born 1949) and also RoseHip syrup and Welfare orange juice. As a young country mum I collected old bottles of many sorts, and have 3 Virol ceramic pots of three sizes. The biggest is "an Institution pot", which stands 10 inches tall. (It now serves as the most elegant lavatory brush holder I have ever seen). I think this would have been too big for a school nurse to cart around, so I believe the "institution" designation.  Anybody interested to see a picture, or museum to acquire?</p>

    <p>So glad that so many others remember Virol....I  thought it was only me! I was born in 1931 so my memories are pre-war. I do not remember having anything extra during the War. My sister was born in 1940 and was the fattest of us all as she had extra milk, orange juice, Farley&#39;s Rusks ( we lived near the factory in Plymouth ) cod liver oil etc. whilst we had to survive on smaller rations and extra school milk. One bright spark I do remember is that after the severe bombing in Plymouth the government ordered huge amounts of sweets to be sent to our area. In particular the sweetshop had big trays of toffee and weird chocolate which they had to break up with a hammer!  One of the toffees was bright green Lime toffee and to this day I am addicted to green sweets ! As others have said, we have survived it all, measles, chicken-pox, german measles and whooping cough plus polio, TB,diptheria, scarlet fever and a few bombs not to mention meals at the British Restaurant !!!!!! Very Best Wishes to all......long live Virol !!</p>

    <p>Thank you for resolving a great mystery to me.  I have found an early gift box circa 1925-1935 of cutlery with "Presented with the compliments of VIROL LTD."  Nothing in Wikipedia, practically nothing anywhere, and here in New York it was never used.  Sounds a lot like a sweet version of marmite.  I see this is a nutritional extra given to British children quite commonly up to the 1960s, and I guess t he cutlery set was to promote the brand.   Cheers!</p>

    <p>Ha ha happy memories.  When I was about five in 1958 my grandfather worked as copywriter for the ad agency that marketed Virol - J Walter Thompson, I think - so going to visit him and my grandmother in Littlehampton always meant large dollops of Virol from one of the several jars in their kitchen and a jar for my parents to take home. Sweet and sticky and delicious. Also remember Delrosa roseship syrup, Farleys rusks,  thick National Health orange juice in those rectangular bottles,   Minadex, and of course dear thrilling Lucozade bought from a chemist with clear orange anti-sun blinds in the window.  No one at school had allergies. Only one was fat. We all got measles, chicken-pox, mumps, etc, and had two weeks off school each time.  Dreaded the little bottle of warm milk at first break but loved school dinners, especially the puddings with custard. Hospitals still used gas then, too. I had my tonsils out at seven and was given too much gas so had to staty in for a month - in the Ear Nose and Throat Hospital on Golden Square in Soho even though we lived in Surrey - and spent my time looking out of the window across to a showroom of a fashion company and trying to avoid the sound of the nun in the next ward retch-coughing horribly.  Happy days. (Well, hope the nun survived.)</p>

    <p>What a treat to read all the above, accidentally discovered while self isolating! I loved Virol - doled out daily by my mother to me and my sisters (2 then 3 of them). I remember it in a brown glass jar with a green lid... and the twist of her wrist as she tried to get it into  our eager mouths before it dropped Off the spoon - eager because it took away the disgusting taste of government cod liver oil, that preceded it and was only tolerated because of the  rewarding Virol to follow. A flood of memories -  including visits to the government office to collect the allocated concentrated orange juice and cod liver oil in small flat bottles with blue screw tops. It was on a sharp corner, (near the port in Rye) with 3 narrow steep steps up to the door- tricky with a bulky push chair, baby,  toddler and small child. As to ingredients - i wonder if it contained rose hip and or orange - there was more to it than just the sticky malt! Not much given tob&#39;looking back&#39; i find myself immersed in previously firgotten memories of rationing, sawdust on the butcher&#39;s floor, Delrosa rosehip syrup, junket, school milk and so on - also the extremely small fridge, meat safe in a proper larder (even in a brand new house), home bottled victoria plums - And so much more...</p>

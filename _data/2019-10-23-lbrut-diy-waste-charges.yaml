    <p>I just now (Thursday 31st Oct)  returned from Townmead Road having offloaded some waste items that I&#39;ve been "hoarding" in my garage for a while and would surely qualify for this new tax.  It was almost as busy as a Sunday afternoon, with many others doing the same. &pound;5 or &pound;10 I think most people would be prepared for but the minimum fee is quite punitive, my few items were nowhere near the 200kg weight up to which &pound;41 will be payable.   As usual this has not been fully thought through by our elite local political masters.  Expect to see an unfortunate increase in fly-tipping across the borough. as a result.</p>

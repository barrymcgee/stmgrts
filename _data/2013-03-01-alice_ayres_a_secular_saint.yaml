    <p>Alice Ayres was the great great aunt of my husband. Her brother, David, never recovered from her death and he committed suicide, his body being found in the Thames at Chiswick.</p>

    <p>My great grandmother was one of the little girls saved by Alice Ayres. I believe she died young when my grandmother was very small. I have a lovely framed photograph of her as a young woman which used to hang in my grandma&#39;s house in Suffolk. My grandma went on to live to be 101 and she and my son share the same birthday 96 years apart.</p>

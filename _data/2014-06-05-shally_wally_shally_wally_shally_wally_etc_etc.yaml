    <p>Surely it relates to the indian name Ganguly. And a ging is another word for a gang . Maybe there was an indian influence rather than african</p>

    <p>1905 occurrence  of the Ging Gang song verified;  Baden-Powell not involved in its creation</p>  <p>It is now proven beyond reasonable doubt that the well known gibberish song Ging Gang (Goo/Gooli/etc) was performed at a New Year&#194;&acute;s cabaret in 1905 (the Folkteater in Gothenburg, Sweden). For that occasion it was named "Nxxxxxx Morning Song" and had "Scandinavian" spelling (e.g. "Hinkan"/"Kinkan" instead of "Ging Gang"; there have been so many different names and spellings all over the world).</p>  <p>Web links (digitized documents, both provided by the National Library of Sweden) ):</p>  <p>page 12 in a jubilee edition 1895-1920 from 1920 <a href="http://runeberg.org/eajubileum/0013.html">r</a></p>  <p>download of the entire cabaret  brochure from 1905 (60 MB), ref. the cover page for location and year, and page 21 in the actual brochure for the song (digitized page 25/31) <a href="http://libris.kb.se/bib/ktghzvx2h8f753cg">l</a></p>  <p>and link to the Wikipedia Ging Gang article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ging_Gang_Goolie">e</a></p>  <p>The 1905 occurrence means of course that the claim that Robert Baden-Powell (supposedly inspired by South African songs and a Mozart piece) wrote the song for the 1<sup>st</sup> World  Scout Jamboree 1920 simply is not true. It also means that whatever claims on origins that post-date 1905 are untrue. And further, that claims for earlier origin than 1905 need be well documented,</p>  <p>It seems very true, however, that the song is part of a family (lyrics-wise and/or tune-wise) of gibberish? songs that were documented primarily in Europe during the end of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century: some so called Anstich Lieder (drinking songs in Germany), Em Pom Pee, Hi Politi, Nicodemo, Kili-Watch, so called Wumba-songs, In Chinesien, etc.</p>  <p>(The National Library of Sweden is both a library and a government agency. It collects, preserves, and provides access to everything published in Sweden - and has been doing so for 350+ years.)</p>

    <p>I&#39;d like to take up Mary&#39;s 2016 suggestion that there is very probably a specifically colonial undertone to the words. They are not quite the gibberish they seem to be. In Jhumpa Lahiri&#39;s novel The Namesake (2004), which follows the trajectory of a Bengali immigrant couple, the Gangulis, on their journey from Calcutta to Massachusetts,  we learn that Ganguli isn&#39;t the family&#39;s proper surname: "[o]n taxi rides through the city, going to visit the various homes of his relatives, [the son Gogol&#39;s] father had pointed out the name elsewhere, on the awnings of confectioners, and stationers, and opticians. He had told Gogol that Ganguli is a legacy of the British, an anglicized way of pronouncing his real surname, Gangopadhyay."  I sang this song a lot as Girl Guide in the UK in the laste 60s.</p>

    <p>Can anyone help please? Trying to trace any history/reference to my late uncle, Harry Turrell. (6848340) After Dunkirk he served with B Squadron, GHQ Liasion Regiment, R.A.C./Phantoms. Any information would be useful as I&#39;m the only direct family member left. Many thanks.</p>

    <p>Hi Michael,</p>  <p>I appreciate it&#39;s a couple of years later, but feel free to drop me an email on mspalmer17 at gmail.com,</p>  <p>My grandad was a Phantom and I&#39;ve spent the better part of a decade researching them.</p>  <p>Mark</p>

    <p>Backwards masking and all the other recording tricks were probably done in case they were exposed.All they would have to say is that if it were a true fraud it would have been stupid to expose themselves. Dual misdirection at its finest. Trying to prove or disprove anything from these albums is a waste of time. DNA and fingerprints do nor lie. Fail once spent over a week in a Japanese jail as his fingerprints did not match the true Paul&#39;s prints. Ringo exposed the scam a few years ago but since then has appeared in several interviews with Fail. No mention of the hoax in any of these later interviews. Why? If Ringo had feared the non disclosure agreement he never would have stepped forward at all. Much money would change hands if true family members could inherit what Faul has taken as his own. Not to mention he would be charged with fraud ad well as all the other Beatles and employees, family members and friends as well.as well. If M15 is actually involved in the switch they could stop the criminal charges in Britain but in the US and the rest of the world they could be open to those charges plus many others. Think of the millions of royalties being given to an imposter. The Beatles never played live again nor come to US for awhile.  Did they see no way around Fail playing his bass with the wrong hand? Were they afraid he would be arrested or have an accident that might expose his false fingerprints, blood or DNA. The anger of the public if he were exposed today is another reason they keep the ruse going. Watch later interviews with Fail and other Beatles members. They all seem to be put off or angry when he refers to himself as McCarthy or speaks of the old times when it was the actual Paul. Faul was to only be a substitute for a week or two, they resent his keeping the ruse going on for 50 years. They have had to keep the fraud covered while Faul reaped the benefits of the fraud. Faul is protected by powerful people and money or he would have been exposed years ago.</p>

    <p>The original Paul was reconstituted from his cryogenically stored parts (possible co-mingled with Ted Williams) in 2002 and was one of the (CIA funded) terrorists who piloted the second plane on 9/11. Duh.</p>

    <p>Anyone who can&#39;t see (or simply refuses to see) the fact that the "Paul McCartney" of Sgt. Pepper onward is not the same Paul McCartney pre-Winter of 1966.  You should read the expose in Italian Wired Magazine where scientists proved beyond a shadow of a doubt with facial recognition software that there are/were two Beatles who went by the name Paul McCartney.</p>  <blockquote><p>"Denial ain&#39;t just a river in Egypt." --- Stuart Smalley</p></blockquote>

    <p>The original Beatle Paul Was most certainly replaced. If you watch the videos of them both playing you will see thatPaul knew the Bass and rarely ever looked at the fretboard in stark contrast to Faul. Of course anyone with two good eyes should be able to tell they&#226;&#128;&#153;re not the same people  Sargent Peppers Is quite a departure musically and full of Luminati influences. Money is power. I believe that had no choice in keeping up the charade, like it or not. Another distorted part of history.</p>

    <p>It seems that someone as talented and no doubt popular as Billy Shears, might have been missed by friends and family, but he just said " Fuck em all. I&#39;m a Beatle Now; and to think that to this day his nuts are still in a vice. Maybe the trip to India and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi made him a believer.</p>

    <p>They are two different people fact, the dna proves it.....why do you think Heather Mills is banned from ever telling the truth? he suddenly paid her off when she threatened to reveal the truth. I work in the music industry and have played with Billy many times over the years and he sometimes slips up with his accent. Ok there has been fraud committed but Billy is actually a much more talented writer than Paul ever was. Makes you wonder who Linda thought she was married to.</p>

    <p>Nonsense. No one&#39;s looks stay the same. His voice was forensically studied and like a fingerprint, it proves the voices to be of the same person. Paul is still alive, but very old now. When i was in my twenties and in the military, my heighth changed and my facial features changed. Everybody is different.  Plastic surgery was in it&#39;s infancy stage in 1966. To make William Shears Campbell look like Paul McCartney then was impossible. Look at live concert videos in 1966 and you can see Paul was already changing from his pudgy round face to a more mature slender version. The Beatles were and still are, the greatest Rock n Roll band ever assembled.</p>

    <p>Anyone that truly believes this is easily led, there is no proof that cannot be explained logically, little hidden messages  on an album isn&#39;t proof someone has died, the Japanese test that said it&#39;s not the same person  well we all know face recognition isn&#39;t reliable even today, his fingerprints not being recognised at the airport, if I play guitar for days on end my phone won&#39;t turn on with fingerprint recognition let alone a bass when you&#39;re fretting with right hand, and for him looking at the fretboard more they are comparing basic rock n roll songs with clips from wings with complex bass lines, and why would John Lennon write a song in 1972 called how do you sleep saying the only thing you done was yesterday referring to his song, which was written in 1965 by Paul, did he write it to annoy someone who is supposed to be dead,</p>

    <p>The main physical proof is the scar on his upper lip from the December 1965 Moped accident. Everything else falls into place. How could they find a musician that looks,sounds just like him &amp; be accepted by the other 3,his family &amp; girlfriend Jane Asher? Also named his 1<sup>st</sup> biological daughter Mary after his departed Mother? That&#39;s something an "imposter" would not do. Also too many stories. Billy Shears ,William Wallace Campbell or Billy Shepherd ?? Also the picture on the White Album that shows him with glasses (passport picture of imposter) would mean Sir Paul/Faul used/uses  contacts most of the time. What about there is not 1 picture of him using glasses occasionally? He was and still is 5&#39;11" hazel eyes. Has not changed. Also as mentioned in other comments,plastic surgery at that time was green. Imagine why we never saw the bruises etc.</p>

What IF faul was knighted for his lifelong dedication to the lie? What IF the "british invasion" was about more than music?  And last, IF you were any of the other Beatles members would you have possibly nosedived your career by going public with the truth??</p>

The photos of Paul, Billy and the Fake Paul after 1966 were the clincher for me not to mention the subtle changes in behaviour. Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and the new Paul was born in 1967.</p>

    <p>Actually billy shears was a stand in double for Paul McCartney. Paul McCartney was Irish, so wouldn&#226;&#128;&#153;t have been singing mull of kintyre. He was a natural left handed player who didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t need to constantly look where his fingers on the guitar were, this one still checks his fingers. The list could go on. The only morons I can see are the ones that need to be told by the mainstream media what to think and when to think it. I feel sorry for you sheeple.

    <p>There are differences in the Bass playing of early Paul and 1966 forward till today Paul. The early bass lines were very simplistic in nature with mainly a 1-5 pattern. In 1967, that all changes suddenly with the emergence of Penny Lane. Paul suddenly unleashes a chromatic downward scale that stays in time, rhythm and has its own distinctive melody. Where did this come from out of the blue? Also, Paul starts to dominate the A-side of the rest of the Beatles hits and he started to out shine the others. When the Beatles were elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Paul did not show up due to personal conflicts with his business scheduling, or so he says. It has come out by George Harrison in an interview with an Australian news source that the Beatles were at odds again financially with Paul because they had learned that from 1967 onward, he received a secret new contract with EMI/Capitol Records that paid him more for his hits and royalties. Why would he agree to do this? Because he is not Paul McCartney and the real Paul would never ever have gone and done something like that behind the other Beatles backs.....yeah-yeah-yeah, right! What do I believe....I do not want to say because my opinion does not mean squat to anyone but myself. You all will have to take what you can dig up and make up your own minds about him, Paul or, Faul.......</p>

    <p>I do not know the Truth here just like most of us, parts of the story seems believable and then again, you catch your self doubting they can pull off such a hoax on the entire world for so damn long. The Beatles were allegedly the first Tavistock owned and operated musical band that exceeded anything that Tavistock ever dreamed that they would become as worldwide famous as they are, still even today. The Illuminati, which this secretive group along with Tavistock own most of the recording industry and has their fingers in most major bands, solo artists money-making pies. In the 60&#39;s, it was all a brand new adventure for all of these parties involved with the Beatles brand name. The Beatles were such a money-making machine that most of their hits singles and LP&#39;s brought in to the GB and enormous Tsunami of $$$$ that it would seem to me that they would not let the death of one of the Beatles stop the cash flow from continuing to come in. If J. Paul McCartney did indeed actually die in a car crash, what happened to his remains? Where is his remains located? How can the McCartney&#39;s (Brother Mike &amp; Father Jim) be convinced to go along with this morbid and sinister cover-up. How could the Remaining Beatles, especially John not feel the sense of betrayal and abandonment towards his deceased best friend Paul. Then there is George, who was brought into the Beatles by his childhood friend, Paul. How could they both go to their own graves keeping this secret with them. That leaves only Ringo and he seems to be on somewhat good terms with Faul or, is it Paul? What about that looney Heather Mills? She goes on and on about some sort of Betrayal that would devastate the world if the truth were to be known. She got a great amount of $$$$ in their divorce settlement and then not a peep anymore from Ms. Mills....We may never know the real truth or, we already do? Someone, knows the truth.......Eh, Beatle Bill?</p>

    <p>Don&#39;t know what to believe about the Paul/Faul conspiracy.  Paul was always the most diplomatic of the Beatles and often served as their de facto spokesman both on and off stage. Just check out the early concert videos. It&#39;s hard to believe that a rift could have developed between Paul and the others. John and Paul were inspiring collaborators, while Paul and George were close schoolmates before the group was even formed.  Early footage shows how Paul always seemed to maintain eye contact with his bandmates and always breaking out his infectious smile.  I don&#39;t enjoy the idea that Paul may have died in an automobile accident.</p>  <p>But remember, Paul was no saint.  He apparently fathered a number of illegitimate children.  Can reports of his belief in an early death be substantiated?  His classic song "Yesterday" hints that maybe Paul was being chased by self-created demons.</p>  <p>Don&#39;t want to say much about who we know today as Sir Paul except that there does appear to be some legitimate questions about changes in his appearance and personality and his relationships with his former bandmates.  He obviously is a very talented and accomplished musician and philanthropist.</p>  <p>WISHED I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY RUMORS OF THE DEATH OF MY FAVORITE BEATLE!!!</p>

    <p>Here is the reality of Facts:  During an interview August 1966 with  journalist Maureen Cleave, John Lennon made this statement: "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn&#39;t argue about that; I&#39;m right and I&#39;ll be proved right. We&#39;re more popular than Jesus now; I don&#39;t know which will go first  rock &#39;n&#39; roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It&#39;s them twisting it that ruins it for me."</p>  <p>This all happened right before they were to tour the US at multiple concert venues.  All four Beatles were concerned for their safety as demonstrations were publicly going on with people burning Beatle albums and pictures.  Even the KKK got involved and made a threatening statement against the group.  After a firecracker was thrown onto a stage, the Beatles were pretty much done with live performances.</p>  <p>Then in June of 1967 the album Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band was released in the US.  Afterward, a college kid did a story on clues he thought he found in the album cover and songs, this created a distraction that John jumped on when he later wrote &#39;Glass Onion", in 1968. " Well,  here&#39;s another clue for you all, the walrus was Paul" The song&#39;s "the Walrus was Paul" lyric is both a reference to "I Am the Walrus" and Lennon saying "something nice to Paul" in response to changes in their relationship at that time. Later, the line was interpreted as a "clue" in the "Paul is dead" urban legend that alleged McCartney died in 1966 during the recording of Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band and was replaced by a look-alike and sound-alike. The line is preceded with "Well, here&#39;s another clue for you all". Lennon himself dismissed any deep meaning to the mysterious lyrics:</p>  <p>&gt; I threw the line in "the Walrus was Paul" just to confuse everybody a bit more. It could have been "The fox terrier is Paul." I mean, it&#39;s just a bit of poetry. I was having a laugh because there&#39;d been so much gobbledygook about Pepper play it backwards and you stand on your head and all that.</p>  <p>Basically, the Paul is dead controversy overshadowed John&#39;s statement and album sales went through the roof with kids trying to find new clues.  Not much was said about Johns comment after that.  So the smoke screen worked.  And here you are 50 years later, still talking about the smoke screen.</p>

    <p>Listen to Paul&#39;s lead vocals in Lady Madonna, Back In The USSR and Oh Darling. It&#39;s all the same singer right? Nobody will argue with that. In fact, if you listen to all Beatles songs between 1967 to 1970, Paul breaks out that particular voice a lot (not always). Now go back and listen to Paul&#39;s lead vocals on any work from 1962 to 1966, and look out for those same distinctive vocals I mentioned. If they appear on his older work too, it&#39;s the same Paul. But if they don&#39;t, he&#39;s been replaced. Make up your own mind.</p>

    <p>Well at last some sense is written! Charlotte A&#39;s comment on Ringo&#39;s singing. Well spotted Charlotte. I have to add that as John said, and I quote when he was asked if  Ringo was the best drummer in the world, he replied with " He&#39;s not the best drummer in the Beatles". Regarding the rediculas conspirasy theory- John and Paul are both still well alive and working at my local Aldi supermarket, Paul collects the descarded shopping trolly&#39;s on the carpark and John bites off thewheels that have a mind of there own, ie: those wheels that want to travel left wile the other three in unison want to travel right, we have all had them!</p>

    <p>Paul had a twin brother, he was more talented so he replaced the original Paul. John wasn&#39;t shot and didn&#39;t die. George died but not the way we were told in the media. Most all of their music was written by others and played by other studio musicians. Not hard to get people to keep quiet, big money let&#39;s people enter another tax bracket, a better life, better health care for their families, and not have to work a job for 30-40 years. Most are from military families that take oaths and sign disclosure agreements where everything can be taken away.  Look at all the staged shootings these days that have been proven hoaxes.</p>

    <p>Paul quit the band over Johns being Yoko Ono&#39;s puppet. Paul&#39;s leaving would have ended them. Shears saved the day. Shears and Paul&#39;s ends of their noses are different and the cheekbones on Paul are somewhat larger. Today, we see the real Paul performing all over the world. Billy likely was killed to be kept silent. The bottom line -- Yoko Ono destroyed the world&#39;s greatest band!</p>

    <p>But Paul was 27, when Abby Road was released. Only John was 28. George was 26 and Ringo 29.</p>

    <p>You can see Paul&#39;s chipped tooth on an early video of RAIN, only available on Russian websites...Dot RU. I was wondering about that, a moped accident that chipped his tooth answered that question. It was repaired expertly as you might expect with someone rich.</p>

    <p>Silario, I read an article about Abbey Road that said the album was supposed to be released a year later than it was (when Paul would have been 28). Perhaps the Beatles did not remember to change the 28IF clue when they published the album cover. Now, on with my original comment. No one noticed the clues on the cover of Revolver. While John, George, and Ringo are all looking to the side, Paul is looking frontward. When the album is turned 90 degrees to the right, it appears that Paul is on a morgue slab or looking up from a coffin. His lips are also a darker color than all of the others, suggesting that his lips are blue (as corpses lips are). Paul is also crawling out of George&#39;s ear (a Beatle, and beetles among other insects crawl out of the ears and eye sockets of corpses). Also, check out this picture of Paul compared to Faul: <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/81T5eUxo6uo/maxresdefault.jpg">i</a> If you need more proof, Ringo has already admitted that Paul died and was replaced by Faul during an interview in his home in California. And have you noticed that Paul&#39;s palate is more narrow than Faul? Teeth pressing up against each other is the reason for Paul&#39;s crooked canine tooth, but as Faul&#39;s teeth are not pressing against each other, there is no explanation except a probable dental surgery. Also, when you play that one part in "I Am the Walrus"backwards where it sounds like complete rubbish, you hear the demonic chanting of "PAUL IS DEAD! HA HA!" And have you ever wondered what on earth the purpose was of writing and recording "Revolution 9," backwards it says "Turn me on, dead man." John also says the line, "I buried Paul," at the end of "Strawberry Fields Forever." And guess what? Faul has admitted that Paul died before during concert. So boom.</p>

    <p>And maybe Ringo did really commit suicide after telling Neil Aspinall he was going to do so, and Ringo was also replaced by a look-alike.</p>

    <p>It took me 10 entire days of intense Web research, but it finally clicked for me. It was thr real Paul&#39;s eyes. Those dreamy eyes I fell in love with in 1963. I keep searching images of Billy, but he does not possess the vulnerability, compassion and depth that once lived in our Paul&#39;s eyes. Anyone that cared at all for James Paul McCartney should look. Really Look.  And Listen. Ignorance today is a choice.  So is laziness-and apathy. I am heart broken about this very recent discovery, but also appreciate knowing the truth.  Afterward, I revisited videos, film clips, songs &amp; interviews with John, George and Ringo, and it all finally made sense.  Thanks.  I am sad.</p>

    <p>It was really John Lennon that died in Nov 1965. The Beatles made up the clues about Paul has a distraction. Look How different John Looks on SGT. Pepper. Between the longer hair and the glasses and beard he was unreconizable by the Abbey Road album. The real Paul was killed in Dec of 1980 by an avid fan and then replaced by Billy Shears.</p>

    <p>No-one can die secretly in England. There are dozens of people involved in a death, certainly in the case of an accident, Police, Ambulance and hospital staff, fire brigade, Breakdown men, registrars, NHI and loads more including family, friends, business colleagues, studio staff and, of course, the Inland Revenue responsible for the collection of income tax and death duties. Also Somerset House staff where all births, deaths and marriages are recorded. It is inconceivable that not one of these people would be tempted to reveal if Paul had died to their families, friends and, most notably, for money to newspapers an TV companies. Not one person did so. The whole &#39;&#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is a load of rubbish perpetrated by idiots and believed by fools.</p>

    <p>Richard :  and anyone else reading this- if you can&#39;t tell Paul from Faul, you&#39;re either not looking hard enough, or you&#39;re not being objective. Then again, there has been so much (&amp; some really bad)  photo tampering all along the way. Billy had been filling in for Paul periodically at least since 1965.  Look at the film footage of The Beatles&#39; appearances on Ed Sullivan when "Yesterday" was performed.  It was Paul the first time, but Billy the second time.  It took some real effort, but I finally saw them as 2 separate, individual guys.  Billy wasn&#39;t the only impostor, but he seems to have been used the most frequently, especially on stage (as opposed to interviews, etc.). Screw the eye Color, you&#39;ll be able to see it in black &amp; white, as well.  Listen to Tina Foster&#39;s interviews. There are some other good sites, like the Sage of Quay &amp; a.d. Clarke. Also, check out IAMAPHONEY.   Even if people don&#39;t like Paul or the Beatles, we all need to recognize the things that are happening under our very noses.  A significant part of my life revolved around the Beatles.  There are more than 50 years of lies for me to swallow.  It sucks being lied to  since.. forever.</p>

    <p>Richard on 2020-05-30 13:24:28  0000    The old "too many people involved" lark.    You&#39;re clearly a disinfo agent.   Faking deaths is done on an industrial scale, not least in phoney terror attacks but also with all those celebs and musicians dropping off their perches - Bowie, G. Michael etc etc.  It&#39;s some people&#39;s day job, gagged with NDAs and the OSA.   Glad most people here are awake to the false reality which surrounds us.</p>

    <p>LOOK, I&#39;ve got ONE thing that makes this whole thing NO MORE than a simple trick. THEY say that hints of Paul dying started in the Revolver album... BUTTTTTTT... the REVOLVER album was recorded and released BEFORE November 9 1966. They wouldn&#39;t be PREDICTING his death, won&#39;t they?</p>

    <p>People think it was too big a lie to be pulled off for this long. Hmmm...how about the lie that gravity holds water on the earth, which water curves around a globe that spins around the sun? One of the main successes of mind control is constant repetition from a young age and "what everybody else thinks." I have not read the book "The Memoirs of Billy Shears" but have listened to enough interviews about the book that I find it harder to believe that Paul was NOT killed in &#39;66. Many people who think of themselves as having open minds will not dare look into it. They do not want to find out that so much of what they have believed all their lives was a lie. It takes a special kind of person: a person who seeks and WANTS truth, even when it embarrasses, hurts or is painful.</p>

    <p>Everyone is looking in the wrong place. Forget Paul.  I&#39;ve never seen any reports about whatever happened to the real Billy Shears. Has he ever re-surfaced anywhere? If he did NOT become Paul McCartney&#39;s replacement, what happened to him?  It can&#39;t be that difficult to find some history on him....if indeed he existed at all.</p>  <p>You know, if investigators find the real Billy Shears working in some factory in Shreveport, LA (his apparent birth place), then you know this whole thing was a hoax. But that hasn&#39;t happened, has it?  And as someone else mentioned, wouldn&#39;t the real Billy Shears have had family and friends somewhere? If you really want to prove that Paul is really Paul, find out what happened to the real Billy Shears. "Thank you very much".</p>

    <p>As an outsider I&#39;m not real sure what to believe here. If someone names William Spears Campbell really won a Beatles look-a-like contest and then dropped off the face of the earth, that would be weird. Nothing ever came to light explaining where he was or what happened to him.  His family and friends??? Maybe bought off. Wouldn&#39;t having William Spears Campbell and the real Paul in the same room saying here we both are, both alive and well no story here have put and end to it all. Unless they got someone to replace Billy Spears so that Billy could replace Paul. After that it would probably start to get weird.</p>

    <p>I&#39;ve always liked the prospect of happy endings. Of course they don&#39;t always happen. But let&#39;s imagine for the purpose of healing that "Paul McCartney&#39;&#39; and John Halliday somehow get to perform "Yesterday" together with Paul introducing John as (a) the writer. What a moment in time to behold! The mystery can live on, but the song becomes further immortalized. Maybe, just maybe John lost both legs in a horrific car accident in 1966, and unwilling to travel for his job found a way to trademark a popular singer&#39;s name, with both entities profiting. Maybe the arrangement wasn&#39;t perfect for their friends, relatives and business partners, but sometimes money and loyalty make for excellent bed partners...so all was made well with John directing and basically slipping into the shadows with little ego, but very fond memories, no bitterness somehow about an accident brought about by his own ignorance. I find peace in thinking about John playing a song he contributed so much to and lived thru in such Grace. What an exemplary life! If he never plays "Yesterday" publicly again, let us all have that moment live in our hope, anyway.</p>

    <p>I spent much of the past year researching this, and even saw Paul in concert in Green Bay last summer. He seemed like the same old Paul albeit older. However, I&#39;ll admit this story may explain all the friction/controversy within the band through the years...</p>

    <p>This is an Amazon book review I wrote on 9 Jun 20 for Billy&#39;s Back!!  This is quite an exceptional read.  Congratulations Mr. William Shepherd as to how you had time to commandeer the Beatles and keep an account of all your personal memories to share with the public. I&#39;m not here to judge you at all.  I do find it fascinating as to how it was all orchestrated with the untimely demise of the real Paul McCartney.  You are correct in your stated assumption that the book had to be written as fiction and that people see what they want to see.  The reality is there are lots of people that are afraid of the truth.  My basic premise in believing the information in the book is because it all makes sense and explains to me why everything happened the way it did within the Beatles circle of friends.  Because without your revelations, nothing makes sense. I turned 64 in May and I celebrated it by playing guitar and singing when I&#39;m 64.  I understand why you were adamant in recording When I&#39;m 64 in the key of C# instead of the key of C because of the vocal recognition of your voice.  I also get the difference in the Eleanor Rigby song that the real Paul McCartney sang and how your voice is completely different from his when you sing Penny Lane.  When I was 11 years old and heard Penny Lane for the first time, I thought to myself who is the new person in the group singing this song and who was singing She Loves You Yeah, Yeah, Yeah at the end of All You Need is Love.  The differences in the parting of the hair, the eye color, the shoe size, the height and Dr Truby&#39;s vocal pattern analysis all make sense.  I&#39;ve been a fan of the Beatles and their music all my life and I have studied this subject at great length for many years in reading about it, watching videos on the topic and making my own conclusions.  I&#39;m not writing this review to sway anyone&#39;s beliefs on how you view Mr. William Shepherd or the author of this book.  I for one, am very grateful to have had the pleasure of reading this most informative book.  Reading this book also provided me with satisfaction and closure to what I always believed that Paul passed on and another took his place.  Oh, and then there is the DVD Paul McCartney Really is Dead-The Last Testament of George Harrison.</p>

    <p>I slept under Paul&#39;s photo...I saw differences but thought We both were just GROWING and CHANGING as we did... This sickens me to my core.... but the truth and lies  are as important as the PEACE and LOVE we practice. If this is true in any way  I could never look at any of reality in the same way.</p>

    <p>Does anyone even think about why the thing was done in the first place. Society was reshaped by having a replacement helping to carry on the Beatles who were the impetus of the revolution. Without Faul they probably wouldn&#39;t have been so influential. The 50s were boring but it was more than a change for cool. It was a change for breaking down tradition and making a world of mind controlled suckers who think it was all about creating a better culture. The question is who or what was behind it? I think most of us know if you have any idea about history at all!</p>

    <p>Okay, I confess.  I am Billy Shears.  I killed Paul and took his identity. You got me.  With all the evidence you&#39;ve presented I&#39;d be a fool to keep the charade going.  I&#39;m going to name my new album Billy Shears III.  I can&#39;t go on like this.  It&#39;s too dark in this closet.  I must come out.  Thanks everyone.  The truth will out and now it finally has.</p>  <p>PS - John didn&#39;t really die.  He faked his death do he could run an ice cream van back in Liverpool.  He now goes by the name of Mr Whippy.  Every time he sells a 99 Flake he gives the game away by asking if you want Strawberry Sauce Forever!</p>  <p>Yours truly</p>  <p>Billy</p>

    <p>the question is how many faux pauls have there been? so far I can find three because the current one has blue eyes, the previous two did not. Everyone concerned is under contract not to disclose. Persons whom have not honoured their contracts or whom have had doubts seem to have died or mysteriously disappeared.</p>

    <p>It would have been easy to replace Paul in the 1960s. Most people didn&#39;t have television, those who did had tiny black &amp; white sets with a fuzzy picture and believed all they saw and were told on that &#39;magical&#39; box at the time. Most people only had radio back then.</p>

    <p>The original Paul McCartney can be seen on YouTube of Queen&#39; s Concert in Britain 1963. The stomp your feet and rattle your jewelry comment by John was famously spoken during concert. There is only one Paul. Those who were alive during the Beatles days recognized that an older replacement(s) was present with SGT Pepper. Both good musicians. The band should have been honest that Paul  was out either by death or choice. A new person could have been accepted but all the lies make original Beatles fans mad!</p>

    <p>I am so happy to see the stables re-emerging from this double whammy of lockdown and the threat of closure. However the kindness of the donations enabling the reopening, does and should not disguise the appalling insensitivity and heartlessness of the landlord who was happy to force the organisation out of the property. Just as there has been publicity for the fundraising, there should be equal amounts of publicity of the landlords identity so that people can avoid the possibility of another similar situation when  lease nears the end. Up to now the landlord seems to have eluded publicity, he/she should be exposed/revealed and face a similar stressful situation that the riding school faced.</p>

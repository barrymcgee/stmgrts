    <p>Dear Mr Day</p>  <p>Thank you for posting your experiences, it sounded as if you really enjoyed being a boy scout.  The history and ethos of the movement is impressive and one that we should be proud of but it would not have happened without Baden-Powell&#39;s vision.</p>  <p>I am saddened by the suggestion of his statue being removed from Poole Harbour.   It is important to look at what Baden-Powell achieved and the positive impact the his Movement has had on millions of boys worldwide.</p>

    <p>Nearly every story I have seen on this has present Powell&#39;s journal entry without context AND removing "- ideals which Hitler does not practise himself." Nor do they even try to find any evidence to the contrary, which is copious, given that Powell&#39;s life&#39;s work was to promote a peaceful brotherhood across nations.</p>  <p>This is journalistic malpractice, and without any shred of context, it&#39;s also Presentism, which is a foolish way to look at historic figures. It needs to be called out as such. Thanks for posting.</p>

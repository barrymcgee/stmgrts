    <p>Dear Mr Day</p>  <p>Thank you for posting your experiences, it sounded as if you really enjoyed being a boy scout.  The history and ethos of the movement is impressive and one that we should be proud of but it would not have happened without Baden-Powell&#39;s vision.</p>  <p>I am saddened by the suggestion of his statue being removed from Poole Harbour.   It is important to look at what Baden-Powell achieved and the positive impact the his Movement has had on millions of boys worldwide.</p>

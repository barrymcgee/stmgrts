    <p>I honor the labour of St. Margaret. And we ask that her labours and prophecies over Scotland speaks again in Jesus name. Amen.</p>

    <p>I, too, am a descendent of St. Margaret of Scotland.  She has interceded for me as well as my mom, also her descendant.  Many prayers were answered.  I am from her eldest daughter, Matilda lineage.  In Savannah Georgia, I was going through old prints. The print of Mathilda fell to the floor. I took it as a sign that Grandma St. Margaret was gonna answer my prayer. She did. Now I treasure the print and St. Margaret Queen of Scotland in my life!</p>

    <p>Two relics of St. Margaret exist today. A part of her shoulder bone is in the St. Margaret Memorial Roman Catholic Church in Dunfermine and a small part of a bone is in St. Catherine&#39;s Catholic Church in St. Louis, Missouri.

    <p>I worked with Joe in South Africa in the &#39;80s. What a nice person with a great sence of humor and a awesome guitarist. I miss you Joe!</p>

    <p>Joe changed the sound of British Rock n Roll and inspired many hopeful guitarists from the early sixties ,without his licks on Brand New Cadillac and Shakin all Over I doubt the UK would not have been taken seriously in RnR .There were many great Brit guitar players but Joe was on the most influential records and made his mark on them.</p>

    <p>To clarify, since I know some people are panicked every time this announcement is made about applying for settled status - it does not apply to all EU citizens.  Irish citizens living in the UK to not have to apply for settled status, their rights - like those of UK citizens in Ireland - are guaranteed under the Common Travel Area</p>

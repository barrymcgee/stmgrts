    <p>It is so typical that concerns from pedestrians concerning the dangers for them of shared space with cyclists have been ignored. Accidents including deaths of pedestrians hit by cyclists are increasing (and now we have to contend with e-scooters) and Richmond is fast turning into a dangerous borough for walking in. Yet our concerns have been ignored constantly. I have narrowly escaped being hit by cyclists jumping lights, or ignoring stopped traffic on zebra crossings. Same with e-scooters.  More needs to be done to protect pedestrians - the least polluting people of all. We don&#39;t leave abandoned hire bikes all over pavements either.</p>

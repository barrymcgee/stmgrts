    <p>Dear Peter, and dear Martyn, a big vote of thanks to you both for this long-lasting and much-appreciated Community Website and its varied and fascinating content.  You will both be missed by many - my husband and I included.  Perhaps an option, after a well-deserved period of rest, might be an annual New Year or Christmas edition, just to keep the spirit going?  But we all understand that good things sometimes have to come to an end.  With huge thanks for all your work on behalf of local residents, and kindest regards, Sue &amp; Noel Josephides</p>

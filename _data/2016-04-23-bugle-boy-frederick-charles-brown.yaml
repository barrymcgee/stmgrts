    <p>A Story of a Boy and a Bugle (23/4/2016) includes a copy of Frederick Charles Brown&#39;s 1918 death notice from the parish magazine which mentioned the L.D.B.S.C. and its motto "I serve".   The  London Diocesan Boy Scout Corp was formed in 1909 and operated in connection with the London Diocesan Church Lads&#39; Brigade but also affiliated with Baden-Powell&#39;s Boy Scout Association.  In 1919, the LDCLB and CLB merged but the LDBSC remained.  The LDBSC adjusted its name to the London Diocesan Boy Scout Association and became more integrated into the Boy Scouts Association eventually disbanding as a separate organisation and becoming a local association of The Boy Scouts Association.  Many LDBSC units decided to stay connected to the CLB and closer to the Church and became CLB companies.

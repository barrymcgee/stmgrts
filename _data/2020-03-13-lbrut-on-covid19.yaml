    <p>We are amazed that so little concern is being shown for the huge risk to elderly and vulnerable people in the borough catching Covid 19, despite numbers of people locally having been diagnosed.  While the rest of the world is taking precautions against the virus, the  vulnerable and elderly here are being put at serious risk by allowing mass sporting events (eg Twickenham) and the Park Run in Richmond Park.  Why this contempt for the vulnerable and elderly?  We need much more confidence that you are taking this pandemic seriously, not just for your residents but for others in the rest of the world.  What immediately effective steps are you going to take to protect your elderly and vulnerable residents?</p>

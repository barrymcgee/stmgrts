    <p>Well done to all the new councillors and commiserations to the loosers. Let&#39;s hope that unlike some of their predecessors they listen a bit more closely the the views of local residents who have just put their trust in them for three years.  I think the result in St Margarets particularly makes the point.</p>

    <p>Thank you St Margarets for your support. In standing I have learnt that the new Councllors do have high hopes to develop working relationships with the community and even a possible role for me. I am, as always, committed to maintain a watching brief to ensure these hopes are turned to actions to benefit St Margarets into the future. (so lets hope I don&#39;t have to stand again, I will if our trust is mis-founded). I wish Geoff, Philip and Ben every success. Well done. I hope this site can develop even further into our communities method of keeping in touch. Love St Margarets. Barry Edwards.</p>

    <p>I am surprised at the huge swing towards the Lib Dems in St Margarets. Anyone have any idea why this may be? (I think Harry and Ann do!)</p>

    <p>Congratulations to Ben, Geoff and Philip.  I suspect they are about to discover that you can&#39;t be the political wing of a residents association and that the only simple things in local government are the slogans and some of their colleagues.</p>

    <p>The lion&#39;s share of the credit for the Lib Dems&#39; success should go to Mike Rowlands of Moormead, who was for many years councillor for the old East Ward, which included St Margarets: he has mentored your new councillors over many months and has tirelessly delivered their leaflets and newsletters throughout the ward.</p>

    <p>Party politics completely to one side, everyone in St Margarets owes a debt of thanks to Mike Rowlands. I&#39;ve lived here since 1978 and I&#39;ve always been aware of Mike&#39;s personal input into, and care for, the Community.  And when he&#39;s not spending time in Wales he can regularly be seen clearing litter from Moormead (and planting daffodils around its trees!).</p>

    <p>Although not a Tory voter by instinct or tradition, I feel a bit sorry for Simon Lamb who did actually stand up for a lot of local residents and listened to our concerns and issues.  The same certainly can&#39;t be said about some other Tory councillors who displayed a stunning disregard for our views and have rightly suffered a pretty humbling defeat.  Hopefully the new councillors will take note and truly respresent voters and residents. Good luck to them.</p>

    <p>Jonathan The only reason I can think of is the complete lack of interest our previous councillors showed in St Margarets. They treated the residents with a breath taking arrogance and behaved as if they had the right to rule. Well the people have spoken now. Its interesting that Simon Lamb now becomes the first Conservative to post on this site after he has lost and is still managing to be rude and condescending to the people of St Margarets. Perhaps he would like to return to Teddington!</p>

    <p>First of all, many congratulations to Geoff, Ben and Philip on a resounding victory. It was a long night at the count, but there was little doubt who was going through for St. Margarets and N. Twickenham.</p>  <p>But second, (and I&#39;m not sure if this is the right forum for this), I&#39;d like to suggest we "sieze the day" and consider making progress on a St. Margarets strategic plan that was discussed here during the campaign.</p>  <p>We could bring in all the residents&#39; associations, the St. Margarets traders, PTAs and any other groups that would have an interest in creating a local community plan. We could address, for example, the Tesco problem, public v. private transport, cycle lanes, parking in Crown Road and surrounding area, home zones in our residential streets, planning preferences, trees other plantings in our streets, etc. etc.</p>  <p>If there was enough interest in taking this forward I&#39;d be happy to pull together an initial meeting.</p>  <p>Peter, could we start the debate here?</p>

    <p>Judy,</p>  <p>Great idea.</p>  <p>Send me an introductory note and I will put it on the homepage and we can start the coversation on that article.</p>  <p>Then let&#39;s get a meeting setup someplace, like Winchester Hall and we can promote it here... and offline as well.</p>  <p>Peter</p>

    <p>I think that Judy&#39;s suggestion for a St Margarets strategic plan is excellent - it will provide an agenda for the community to present to its elected representatives - keep them "on message" and working on our behalf.</p>  <p>Count me in.</p>  <p>Thank you Peter for providing this forum for us to express our views.</p>

    <p>Ann - when Simon(Lamb)says "the only simple things in local government are the slogans and some of their colleagues", I think we should give him the benefit of the doubt in that he may well be referring to one of his former blue colleagues as opposed to the three new musketeers.</p>

    <p>Harry - you may be right, lets move on. I think the idea for a St Margarets community plan is great. It could include availability at local schools and oppportunites for access to secondary schools as well as local facilities and the use of Marble Hill park as a start. An agreed local plan could move us beyond local party politics towards creating a joined up, vibrant, functioning local community. A welcome step away from point scoring and political back biting. Here&#39;s to the future!</p>

    <p>Could I suggest that people refer to the appropriate section of the UDP before launching a strategic review of St Margarets?  Much of the work has already been done - at least, problems and some potential solutions have been identified - so this should be the starting point.  And to preempt the Liberal smart alecks, I have read it!</p>  <p>My Council computer dies on Monday so this may be my last posting for some time.  I hope last week marks a bump in the road rather than the end of the line.  We need to work out what went wrong.  The result was a major surprise to many and we were the only Council in the whole country to fall to the Liberals.</p>  <p>I have enjoyed my 8 years on the Council.  It is onerous and consumes vast amounts of time but it is a privilege to serve and I hope many people feel I made their lives slightly better by my actions.  It is also good fun and mentally stimulating so I do hope to make a return some day.</p>  <p>PS: My last posting was deliberately ambiguous but Harry was fairly close to the mark.</p>

    <p>Thank you to Simon, for his advice re. the UDP and the proposed strategic plan.</p>  <p>For what it&#39;s worth, I believe Simon has been honourable, charming and hard working, and deserves thanks for his commitment to public service. It&#39;s a pity that he had one and a half eyes on his position in his party, and not much left for the people whom he represented.</p>  <p>But I wish him all the very best and hope to contest elections against him another day.</p>

    <p>Simon - if you need time to work out what went wrong you haven&#39;t been listening!</p>  <p>Let&#39;s start by consulting the UDP Oh yes sections for everywhere except St Margarets, look a bit further and you might find a few footnotes. But no evidence of any community involvement or consultation.</p>  <p>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed your eight years on the council Simon perhaps now you can find something else to fill up your days.  <a href="http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/environment/planning/unitary_development_plan.htm">http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/environment/planning/unitary_development_plan.htm</a></p>

    <p>&#39;The result was a major surprise to many&#39;: but not to the Lib Dem team who had been campaigning for many months when the sitting councillors were nowhere to be seen.</p>  <p>I absolutely agree that the first step must be for everyone to &#39;read, mark, learn and inwardly digest&#39; the UDP. Otherwise they will come forward with a raft of perfectly sensible [from many points of view] but in fact hopelessly utopian ideas, which will come to naught. The electors have already been offered a utopian proggramme and have rejected it, so discussions now should be pragmatic and firmly grounded in what residents really care about, i.e. parking.</p>  <p>David Cornwell, for many years councillor for East Ward, which included St Mag&#39;s, summed matters up thus:</p>  <p>&#39;parking, b**y parking! I didn&#39;t come into public life to worry about b**y parking!&#39;</p>

    <p>Actually Chris what this particular resident really cares about is how one family is managing to change the face of St Margarets.  Let&#39;s not forget that it&#39;s the Phelps family who have brought us Tesco&#39;s, Superdrug and now a 150 seater wine bar that was rejected on this website by 80% in a vote, and over 250 written objections. If people think parking is bad now, just wait until that wine bar opens.</p>

    <p>Personally I would like to thank the outgoing Councillors for all their hard work.  Whether we like how they voted on particular matters or not, the job takes a lot of time for nearly no money.  And as Simon has suggested, I think there are realities and complexities that we often are not aware of or appreciate regarding many issues.</p>  <p>If Annie or Simon has any suggestions, ideas or advice for the new Councillors or residents from their experience, we would love to hear it.</p>

    <p>On behalf the "three musketeers"I would like to thank everyone for their good wishes and congratulations. I am looking forward to working with other active members of the community on issues mentioned here before.</p>  <p>All three of us are new to the council and have a lot to learn so excuse us if we adopt a gently gently approach while we find our feet and to this end I would appreciate any input from the outgoing councillors.</p>  <p>Ben Khosa</p>

    <p>Ben cannot expect me to give him too much helpful advice.  I can only suggest that he steers clear of planning applications in this Borough and that they avoid the Grim Reaper - 4 deaths in the last 4 years gave the Liberals the momentum they needed to recover from the rout of 2002.</p>  <p>At a local level, I would suggest they make full use of the &#39;Members Express&#39; service we established which is a fantastic way of getting quick and accurate information on concerns raised by residents (within the ambit of the Environment Directorate).</p>  <p>I would also suggest they work out a division of labour - whether by theme or polling district is up to them - so that multiplication is avoided.  Also, try to have some goals for the local area so that they are not too bogged down with issues affecting the whole borough.</p>  <p>Only those who have been on the inside can truly appreciate the competing demands on your time and attention for the next 4 years.  I trust your families are understanding.  Take full advantage of the training offered by the Council. We have a great bunch of intelligent and professional officers who will steer you around the minefields and sort out what is possible from the merely utopian.  Whether you take their advice is up to you.</p>  <p>I can&#39;t honestly say I wish you luck since politics is a zero sum game but I hope you come to appreciate the complexities of the problems and do your best to make the ward an even better place than it is already.</p>

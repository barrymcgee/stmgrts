    <p>I was ten in 1942 and read about Paddy Finucane. I cannot remember how but I found his parents address, and wrote to them asking for a photograph . To my delight and suprise they sent me one, which I still have and still treasure. I am now eighty eight and still look at it from time to time. Don&#39;t know if anyone is interested, but thought I&#39;d mention it.</p>

    <p>My Father-in-Law, John Frisby was an American who joined the Canadian RAF 11/41. His pilot log shows him returning from a mission in France on the fateful day Paddy perished in the Channel. He notes in the log that he circled the area of the crash for some time looking for signs of life before having to return to base. John ended up transferring to the US Army Air Corp, retiring in 1971 as a Full Colonel. We lost him at age 95 in 2015.</p>

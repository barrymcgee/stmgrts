    <p>I was ten in 1942 and read about Paddy Finucane. I cannot remember how but I found his parents address, and wrote to them asking for a photograph . To my delight and suprise they sent me one, which I still have and still treasure. I am now eighty eight and still look at it from time to time. Don&#39;t know if anyone is interested, but thought I&#39;d mention it.</p>

    <p>Martyn, thank you for this moving, powerful piece. I too am certain about the Holocaust. I will share your writing with others.</p>

    <p>No disrespect, but the man photographed in the photos and in the moving video without the scarf across his face was my grandfather, Alfred Lavender.  He told me the story of riding the bulldozer and cleaning up the bodies.  He was in the advance party that went into Belsen to open the gates before the rest of the troops and tanks arrived.  He was SAS (I found this out later when more information was released in the past few years, declassified that is).  There were 2 men who rode that bulldozer, but one could not stand it any longer.  I have a close up of the photos also.  The reason I know that there were two because of two facts: my grandfather told me, and I got confirmation of this from the curator of the commemoration museum at Belsen.  My grandfather never really got over what he saw, and the first thing he mentioned was the children, and how if he had marched faster, that he could have saved them.  This story has been with our family for all my life, and I was the first he told about this.  Additionally, if you look at the cap badge on the hat of the driver of the bulldozer, it is not the same as the above gentleman.  The cap badge is SAS.</p>  <p>What is also concerning here is the man with the hankerchief was named as Frank Chapman.</p>

    <p>In response to &#39;A&#39; who posted 23/4/18 (I hope that you see my comment!). What brought me here too was this picture, and what drew my attention is there are 2 photos I have found online with men wearing different caps.  You see, I am looking for photos of my grandfather in WW2. He was at the liberation of Belsen. And he has said, in his time, he drove a bulldozer there.  What I have been wondering tonight, and before I even found your comment and this page, is whether there was more than one bulldozer? For sure there cannot only have been one person with the/a bulldozer. I hope that you see this message!</p>

    <p>Just come across this message board, &amp; in response to the above comments about Dozer operators in Bergen-Belsen. My late Father "Tom Turner" was a British Army Royal Engineer Sapper (59 Mechanical equipment platoon) and was sent to the camp with Dozer &amp; crew in late April 1945 &amp; was responsible for digging out &amp; burying dead in atleast Grave 11, &amp; maybe more. I have been researching his time at Bergen Belsen for some years, &amp; I would like to say that there were not maybe one or two Dozer operators, but atleast seven that I have so far managed to identify. He too wore a handkerchief around his face as did his crew &amp; I am sure all the Dozer operaters due to the Typhus epidemic.</p>

    <p>Interesting. My father was in the Royal Engineers and was called into Belsen. He didn&#39;t talk about it much and I only got to know from others in the family when there was a program on tv called the Holocaust which he didn&#39;t let us watch as said some things should be left in the past. He was a very quiet man and easy going so it was unusual for him to put his foot down on something. His mate in the army was a guy from Leeds who was much older than him as referred to him as old Bill and his surname was Garfield or Gatfield. My dad was a giveaway in that he often drove machinery such as a bulldozer standing up and there is a video of someone young doing this at Belsen which seen years ago on tv and immediately thought that is him. In later life I asked him and although he generally changed the subject do know that they were clearing roadblocks with the bulldozers as the army advanced when they were sent into Belsen which was nearby where they were at the time. So there would have been more than one crew there to clear it up. After the war in Europe was over my father with his mate Auld Bill were sent to Palestine where they were used to keep the road clear to Gaza, as used to get blocked by sand. He talked about that a lot &#x1F44D;</p>

    <p>Very interesting, and throws light on the background to the story we were told by the guide on a walk round Isleworth yesterday. We didn&#39;t know the same boys had been responsible for the Hounslow fire, or that they&#39;d started three others. They were lucky their names remained unknown - wouldn&#39;t happen nowadays!</p>

    <p>Can&#39;t be many folk left who remember the old All Saints church now. I moved to Isleworth from Berkshire in 2004 and subsequently researched my family tree, only to discover my direct ancestors were married in All Saints Isleworth 200 years before (that was as far back as I could trace).  Today I live in the same parish - such an unlikely coincidence! ...and such a shame the church was destroyed. It&#39;s good to see a photo of it at last.</p>
